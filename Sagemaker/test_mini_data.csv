Gould had founded TFF in 2011 as a next-generation innovation platform for sustainable food and agriculture. In its first four years of operation TFF had helped more than 5000 university students generate viable business plans to address the vexing problem of feeding more than 9 billion people by 2050 (see Exhibit 1). At least 18 new student-led companies had been launched and increasing numbers of professional mentors and support organizations were now joining the TFF global challenge and summit.In 2015 Gould had to make a difficult decision: to either maintain TFF’s current status as an internal initiative at Syngenta or register it as an independent non-governmental organization (NGO). Syngenta had provided critical financial support as Gould had launched the TFF platform and importantly it had allowed her to allocate some of her working hours to the initiative. But now that TFF had reached the scale that required significant funding and a dedicated staff and leader Gould wondered if it would be better to take the platform outside. Independent NGO status would enable the organization to raise funds from a wider base of supporters but there was no guarantee that those funds would actually flow. Gould wondered if the enhanced flexibility outweighed the increased risk. She also wondered how senior Syngenta colleagues would view the move. They had encouraged her to keep TFF as an internal Syngenta initiative back in 2011 when she had been planning to leave the company as an entrepreneur focused on nurturing early-stage food and agriculture start-ups. Would they once again push her to maintain TFF’s inside status now that the organization’s industry impact was growing but required additional resources?TFF’s OriginsGould launched TFF in 2011 convinced that next-generation innovation was the key to solving humanity’s most pressing food challenges. Her inspiration began when she studied for her master’s degree in agriculture system innovation at Columbia University where her peers and colleagues were passionate advocates of openness transparency and cross-sector collaboration aimed at altering the agricultural status quo through innovative business models. Later when she joined Syngenta she found that these ideals sharply contrasted those of the policy makers and industry leaders she encountered in her work. The complexities of agricultural regulations and the need for large-scale solutions led most industry experts to believe that global food challenges would ultimately be solved through traditional product-based technology research done by incumbent firms with laboratories scientists legal teams and other resources required to bring new ideas to market. For a firm like Syngenta to gain the approvals needed to launch a new active ingredient for crop protection for example it could take more than 10 years of research and legal processing at a cost of US$280 million. It was hard for industry insiders to see how business-model innovations and low-tech solutions from outside the traditional systems could have an appreciable effect on global food production in the near future. At the same time Syngenta executives were sensitive to ongoing societal changes that posed risks to their traditional business model. For example although investment in agricultural technology had been increasing rapidly in recent years there was a troubling trend of growing public distrust of big agribusiness in general and of technological innovations in particular (see Exhibits 2 and 3). Technological agricultural innovation primarily took the form of chemical modifications to pesticides and other crop protectors seed breeding using biotechnology and genetic methods or cultivation of bio-pesticides and all of these technologies were controversial in the eyes of the public. Regulators were increasingly recognizing public views on the wisdom of new product approvals and public distrust represented the growing risk that some long-term innovation projects would never be commercialized. Most Syngenta leaders felt that public opinion about the need for traditional agricultural innovation and the benefits of these would align with those of industry if citizens had a realistic understanding of how modern food systems worked and how much time and effort went into assuring the safety of new products before their release. Michael Kock global head of intellectual property at Syngenta pointed out the risks of weak public understanding: “People have a romantic view of how food security works and what it means to be an innovator. Many negative perceptions are based on a lack of understanding which in the end limits an innovation’s potential to solve problems.” A second worrisome trend for the industry was the changing work preferences of the millennial generation. University graduates increasingly chose to work in small- and medium-sized businesses or to launch their own entrepreneurial start-ups. Few young people entered the farming industry directly. According to Kock in 2011 Syngenta could “already see that the way of attracting researchers in the past by offering lifelong employment and a secure income was no longer attractive for the next generation [which] wants to work on projects in an open environment and change companies every few years.” There were concerns that this trend could drive fundamental changes in the nature of future research. Some company leaders were looking for ways to explore possible future innovation scenarios. Consequently when Gould announced her plan to leave Syngenta and launch TFF as an entrepreneurial venture senior colleagues encouraged her to launch it as an internal Syngenta project instead. Executives welcomed the opportunity to test new ways of speaking to young people and to gain perspective on youth employment needs and requirements. Gould was offered a newly created position in the department of external affairs dedicated to next-generation innovation and engagement (see Exhibit 4) and she was allocated a budget to support the first innovation challenge. Happy to have the freedom of an entrepreneur along with the structure and security of a corporate job Gould agreed to the arrangement.Launch and Early GrowthThe first TFF Challenge was a simple event that invited university students to think deeply about global food challenges and how to address them. Company executives who attended the event were pleased to see young people gaining a deeper view of both agricultural realities and the complexities involved in finding solutions. What they did not expect was the depth of passion that the challenge evoked in these young enthusiasts and the resulting speed of TFF’s growth. Participants spread the news of TFF over digital and university networks and the number of challenge participants grew significantly each year (see Exhibit 5). TFF and the winning teams from the annual challenge also attracted the attention of international media outlets like Huffington Post Forbes and Fast Company. TFF’s Facebook page had already accumulated more than 9000 followers by 2014. In response to this growing visibility and enthusiasm Gould continuously expanded the scope and professionalism of activities. By 2014 TFF had evolved into a multifaceted platform for cultivating and launching transformative food system innovations and building the human capacity needed to achieve that ambitious goal. The platform was uniquely designed to attract and empower the next generation of youth who had the passion for a more sustainable world the willingness to change the status quo and the cutting-edge technological knowledge of digital natives. TFF made an impact through three key pillars: the TFF Challenge an annual two-day summit and its diverse global community. The TFF ChallengeThe TFF Challenge invited university students from all fields of study to generate prototypes for previously unseen solutions to the complex challenges of global food security. Applicants were invited to use online training resources to improve their ideas and develop business plans. Gould commented “We expected to see bold and innovative technologies with the latest resources . . . [but] innovations are not enough. The projects had to be implementable with serious scalability potential on a global level.” Applicants who made it onto the competition’s shortlist received individual coaching to cultivate entrepreneurial go-to-market skills. As such the platform was instrumental in transforming students into innovative entrepreneurs regardless of their final placements in the competition. Participants found the experience inspiring and transformational and after four years several had already succeeded in launching start-up businesses (see Exhibit 6). Max Loessl co-founder of Agrilution GmbH (Agrilution) commented on the experience: “Before we got in touch with TFF our team was just developing ideas around vertical farming and brainstorming about how to get involved in this new technology. TFF pushed us to make our idea more realistic and business oriented.” Gerald Perry co-founder of FoPo Food Powder (FoPo) agreed: “TFF was the first single step for us to start our journey. [In response to] all the encouragements and pressures we went to Philippines and tested our business plan.” The Two-Day Annual TFF SummitThis second pillar brought together competing teams of students entrepreneurs investors and thought leaders working in food agriculture innovation entrepreneurship and science. TFF summits had a stimulating and unique style that prompted participants to call them their “best event[s] personally and professionally.” In addition to the final competition the program included inspirational talks from leaders at cutting-edge organizations like the XPRIZE Foundation IDEO and the Kirchner Impact Foundation. It also included skill-building sessions and learning games that explored innovation impact sustainability and emerging technologies like precision agriculture vertical farming and synthetic biology. Participants were encouraged to learn and to make the most of networking opportunities. The Diverse and Passionate TFF Global CommunityTFF’s third pillar was a stable community of individual enthusiasts and organizations that were leading the search for agricultural innovations in their respective fields. TFF sought to pool the expertise of this group to solve problems that no single person institution community or country could realistically conquer alone. Since next-generation innovation was an open collaborative experimental approach to finding solutions the TFF community served the important role of assuring ongoing collaborations among those who had initially engaged in competitions. Community members were committed to actively teaching and coaching one another and also to connecting and sharing resources.Choosing the Path to ScaleBy 2014 TFF’s rapid growth had made Gould and her colleagues question its long-term viability as an internal corporate initiative. The budget allocated by Syngenta had been increased each year to total $600000 by 2014. This covered platform development costs and direct expenses for the annual challenge and summit; nevertheless it was not sufficient to support a full-time dedicated staff and this created a critical bottleneck in TFF’s development. Taking TFF outside Syngenta would give Gould the flexibility to raise additional operating and investment funds from other individuals and institutions concerned about food security and agricultural innovation. Independent status would also make it easier for TFF to work with professionals who otherwise might fear conflicts of interest when collaborating on Syngenta-funded projects. Syngenta had always been hands off with TFF allowing Gould to build without directly promoting Syngenta interests. Nevertheless Gould saw a need to assure participants that TFF was not a public relations project for Syngenta but rather a truly collaborative attempt to find food-security solutions. Independent NGO status would immediately resolve all of those concerns and support TFF’s evolution into a third-party platform serving the interests of the entire industry. In fact by serving the industry TFF might offer even greater value to Syngenta. The entire agribusiness industry was gradually moving away from selling isolated products and toward selling integrated solutions. Gould’s colleague Kock had noted that Syngenta could “produce a building block for the solutions” but could not produce solutions in their entirety. He saw a need “to collaborate with others by design in order to integrate the building blocks into a solution.” An independent TFF might have even more opportunities to safely explore new technologies and collaborative business models without immediately affecting core business activities.  On the other hand the TFF competition and summit greatly benefitted from Syngenta’s commitment and industry-leading support as well as from the personal time devoted by participating company leaders and professionals. Gould knew she could count on Syngenta’s continuing support for TFF if she took it outside but if she wanted to appreciably grow TFF inside Syngenta she would have to identify and demonstrate its tangible value for the firm. Until now TFF had been housed in the external affairs department where Gould worked. Nurturing relations with the millennial generation and a broader community of interested professionals clearly delivered value to external affairs. Moreover Syngenta executives had been very pleased that TFF had provided more than the initially desired medium for delivering Syngenta’s views to the public. Indeed TFF drove deep dialogues and two-way conversations among people with very different views. As Steve Maund head of Syngenta’s global License-to-Operate platform said “I see value in talking to outsiders. If you have conversations only with those who agree with you you don’t learn very much.” Gould had regularly briefed Syngenta staff and executives about her insights on millennials and the firm had recruited several TFF alumni. Clearly TFF brought value to Syngenta’s human resource team. Maund noted an even broader contribution:People want careers with purpose. If you can [connect people] and express the ideas [of working together on solutions] as TFF and we in License-to-Operate try to do it brings meaning in itself. Corporations that engage in these types of activities will be much more attractive to the next generation of employees. . . . Some [TFFers] may develop a passion for innovation that lasts their entire life. They will study agriculture go into research or launch startups to work on agriculture innovation. Out of that process real innovation will emerge.Bangladeshi student Lamia Anwar Shama was a case in point. She noted “When I started my undergrad as a business student I thought I would become a banker. But after I participated in the TFF Challenge and won I shifted my interests and ended up working in the agricultural sector.”Nevertheless until the innovations emerging from TFF could be incorporated into the company’s product innovation cycle the business case for Syngenta would be difficult to assess. Despite repeated attempts by Gould and others the goal of leveraging TFF had not yet been attained. As Juan Gonzalez Valero Syngenta’s head of public policy and partnerships pointed out There were real discussions about whether we could help some of these ideas to grow by incorporating them in our innovation cycles but most ideas were not sufficiently developed to grow within an organization like Syngenta. We even looked at the possibility for joint sponsorship of some ideas but that did not materialize either.In practice the TFF ideas that had gone to market up to this point were either low-tech improvements to existing food systems—primarily in developing economies—or modifications to agricultural business models like vertical farming. As a product-driven company Syngenta struggled to see how business-model innovations could be of use. The seeds of some very interesting early-stage technology innovations had appeared in the TFF Challenge but no one had been able to bring those ideas into Syngenta’s business activities or research labs which of necessity had to focus on much more mature technologies.A Future Within Syngenta?With $13.4 billion in sales and more than 28000 employees in 2015 Syngenta was a leader in agricultural innovation (see Exhibit 7). Approximately 10 per cent of its revenues were allocated to research and development each year even in periods of market downturn generating a very strong pipeline of products under development. Company leaders were deeply committed to sustainability and Syngenta was one of four co-sponsors of the Vision 2050 project of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Former chief executive officer Michael Mack and Valero were key contributors to the WBCSD’s work of developing a blueprint for achieving the well-being of 9 billion people living within the limits of the planet. In addition to this external collaborative work with other multinational corporations (MNCs) Syngenta executives were formulating ideas for an integrated company strategy that would transform the traditional culture and mindset from its previous narrow focus on objective science and technology innovation to a more comprehensive view of technology serving the land and the people who worked it. In 2013 Syngenta announced its Good Growth Plan—a commitment to continuous improvement on six specific and measurable sources of value to society including resource efficiency ecosystem rejuvenation and the strengthening of rural communities (see Exhibit 8). The engine for achieving these targets remained firmly rooted in product-based technological innovation. That model had served Syngenta well and the firm had amassed critical skills and resources for maximizing its value. No one believed the fundamental business model should be altered but there was a growing view that broader change was on the horizon and would require more vigilance than the company had needed in the past. Maund elaborated: Gould and I tried to challenge the organization to think a bit more broadly than our traditional business model methods because both of us saw the need for our organization to evolve. You need your big machinery to scale and address a global market but you also need the lean mean fighting machines with the startup mentality to be sure that you avoid a Kodak moment of missing the new trends.Robert Neill Syngenta’s head of global product marketing addedThe big value for me of TFF was preventing narrow-mindedness. The TFF teams came up with fantastic ideas that addressed a huge variety of opportunities. Maybe their particular ideas wouldn’t immediately make it to market but they sure challenged you to think outside the box! It was very energizing.As Maund observed “There is a danger that in big companies we business-case new ideas to death. I recall a Silicon Valley speaker once saying that an innovation is unlikely to prove disruptive if it fits your current business model.”Although she was happy to hear these supporting views Gould questioned whether she could produce any measurable evidence of their validity. She was acutely aware that Syngenta like most MNCs facing an ongoing global market slowdown had in early 2014 launched a cost-cutting program intended to save $1 billion by 2018. In such an environment she would have to develop tangible impact measurements to justify TFF’s growing space within the organization. Some scholars and consultants were beginning to develop metrics for the softer elements of sustainable business such as employee and stakeholder engagement but no standards had yet emerged. She certainly could not devote her time to that problem when so much other work was needed to maintain the momentum she had worked so hard to build with TFF.An Independent Future?Although independence would allow TFF to seek new funding sources the work of securing the funds would put huge pressure on an already lean management team. Moreover Gould needed to sharpen TFF’s value proposition for everyone involved. She had to articulate the value to financial sponsors and the value that would keep TFF community members actively participating over time. Of course she also had to assure that there was value for new students so they would continue to enter the TFF Challenge each year. So far students had been motivated by sheer passion for starting businesses and finding sustainable food systems and by the opportunity to experience the unique TFF Summit and be coached by experienced mentors. Of course students also liked travelling to the summit which was held in a different national capital each time. If TFF were to have a real impact on food stability moreover Gould would have to further develop the potential of taking innovative ideas to market. Kock had noted “TFF brings together students industry academics startups coaches and sponsors but all of that is not so well orchestrated that you can say [TFF is] maximizing the potential for industry innovation.” The TFF Challenge and Summit did a great job of kick-starting the go-to-market process but sustained and continuous investments of professional time and money would be needed to fully nurture most of the TFF Challenge ideas. Building the TFF community into a formal incubator or accelerator might be one path to follow. Gould wondered what additional resources and activities she would have to employ to realize that type of solution. A very different possibility would be to reorient the TFF Challenge so that it was no longer strictly a student competition but a public incentive prize challenge instead like the XPrize which offered large crowd-sourced financial rewards to anyone who could provide answers. Gould knew such approaches had been used to generate late-stage prototypes to specific information technology and engineering challenges but it wasn’t clear that they could generate viable ideas to address a broader challenge like ensuring global food security. In her view these approaches had another more serious flaw: they had little potential to cultivate the dedicated community of next-generation innovators that she and other TFF mentors were so passionate about. Edward Silva executive director of TFF commented on this community:The communities that support incentive prize competitions are often an undervalued asset. They bring diversity that boosts the potential for creative interaction. It is clear from TFF summits that out-of-the box solutions—those that really push the edge of the envelope—happen when food and agriculture intersect with other fields.In his view large open challenges were unlikely to really push the edge. He therefore favoured small incentive prize competitions focused on issues like vertical farming or open data conducted in partnership with other organizations seeking insight ideas and talent. It seemed that no matter what path TFF followed there was work to be done. TFF had been successful so far in building interest and an understanding of global food challenges nurturing ideas to resolve those challenges and building the human capacity to put the ideas into action. With the right boost in resources and the right shift in focus TFF could continue on that accelerated path. As she pondered the next moves Gould realized that much was at stake. Exhibit 1: The Challenge of Feeding over 9 billion people by 2050In a presentation at the 2016 TFF Summit in Zurich scientist and agriculture change agent Mike Gould pointed out the following information: For 10000 years agriculture was sustainable. Productivity was low but the population was small (less than 2 billion before 1900) and resources were plentiful. However in the 20th century the human population increased at an unprecedented rate reaching to more than 6 billion by 2000. New technologies bring dramatic increases in agricultural production but also require massive inputs of non-renewable energy water and chemicals. This model is not sustainable as the world population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050. This means we need to produce as much food as the entire human population has produced in the past 10000 years. As we are already using nearly all the farmable land on the planet and 70% of the earth’s fresh water we need to find new more sustainable agricultural technologies that provide very high productivity but require lower input of arable land fresh water and fertilizers.Compounding the problems of population growth and natural resource limits noted by Gould in his 2016 speech modern agricultural systems were stressed in the 20th century by a rapidly growing demand for protein. As poverty declined new middle-class families switched from plant- to meat-based sources of protein. Since livestock farming was more resource intensive (e.g. in terms of feed water and land) and emitted more carbon than crop farming planetary systems underwent a double hit as the population swelled. The poverty and low education levels of smallholder farmers posed another major challenge. In a short-sighted drive to boost crop yields and incomes uneducated farmers overused pesticides and fertilizers eventually triggering runoff that contaminated water and soil resources for future use. Smallholders also under-invested in safety precautions leading to injuries and toxic exposures. Finally the search for income growth drove younger generations of farming families off the farm and into the cities for jobs and education. Farm communities faced potential collapse or extinction as the pool of skilled labour declined.

This note provides a guide to options trading for entry-level traders and represents a logical next stage to the note An Introduction to the Pricing of Options. The note reviews characteristics of options and the factors affecting their valuation and outlines several trading mechanisms that new options traders might use as they seek their most effective strategies. These mechanisms include long call short put bull call spread short call long put bear put spread short straddle short strangle long butterfly long straddle and long strangle. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION Options are financial products that derive their value from an underlying asset. They are leveraged financial instruments that allow traders to make a higher return on a smaller outlay than they might make by investing directly in the underlying asset. Options give traders increased exposure to changes in the value of the underlying asset; that is traders can profit and lose more with an option than with the underlying asset itself.Options are bought and sold. A buyer is said to take an option and is thus referred to as a taker. A seller is said to write the option and is thus referred to as the writer.There are two types of options: call options (calls) and put options (puts). Calls give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) before or at the expiration date of the option. Puts on the other hand give the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price before or at the expiration date. Both calls and puts share the same uniform characteristics: premiums maturity strike price an underlying asset and option style.OPTION CHARACTERISTICSPremiumA premium is the amount a buyer pays to receive the option; that amount changes on a daily basis. When a trader buys an option (takes a long position) the trader pays the premium. When a seller writes an option (takes a short position) the seller receives the premium. The premium compensates the option seller for taking on the risks associated with writing the option.The premium for an option is the sum of the option’s intrinsic and time values. The intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset. The time value represents the amount a buyer is willing to pay for the possibility that the market will move before the option expires. As the amount of time available decreases the opportunity to become profitable declines; this decline in value is referred to as time decay. Time value is influenced by several factors: market volatility time to expiry future dividends and interest rates.Maturity Maturity is the time remaining between the date the option is purchased and the date the option expires. The majority of options bought and sold have a maturity of a month. However the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) list both options that expire in a month and those that expire in a week providing traders with a choice of maturity. When deciding on a trading strategy traders need to consider when and over how much time (the time period) their predicted event or movement will occur. As the needed amount of time increases (the maturity gets longer) the associated premium increases because the option writer takes on a greater risk. Strike PriceStrike price is the predetermined price a buyer will pay if exercising the option to purchase the underlying asset. The strike price is locked in with the options contract. For instance on August 19 2016 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) stock was trading at A$73.12. Assume a trader believed the share price was going to rise so took a long position in a call option—that is took an option to purchase the underlying asset—with a strike price of $73.00. The trader would have the right to buy CBA shares at $73.00 regardless of the market price up to the option’s expiry date.Underlying AssetEach option derives its value from an underlying asset. Options on both the ASX and the CBOE derive their value from either equities or indexes. The CBA example discussed above under “Strike Price” would be classified as an equity option because the option value is derived from an individual company’s stock. In contrast the value of an index option is derived from the underlying index (e.g. S&P500). Options less frequently use commodities as the underlying asset; commodities traders prefer trading with other derivative instruments such as futures and forwards. Option StyleThere are two option styles available on the ASX: American and European. An American style option allows the option holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiry date; European style options in contrast can only be exercised at maturity. Index options are all European style while equity options can be either style based on trader preferences. CBOE equity options are all American style. American and European style options are the most frequently used styles; however there are numerous other styles. The styles vary mainly in terms of the rights to exercise the options; for example a Canary option allows the option holder to exercise the option at quarterly dates but not before a set period of time has elapsed. Another a Bermudan option gives the holder the right to exercise the option a set number of times prior to maturity. Contract SizeAll single stock options traded on the ASX have an initial standardized contract size of 100 underlying shares. On rare occasions the contract size may be adjusted to compensate for corporate actions on the underlying asset such as issuing new shares. In general a standardized contract size means a trader who has purchased a call option on CBA stock would have the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 CBA shares at the predetermined price any time up to the option’s maturity. Index options (e.g. XJO) are usually standardized at an index multiplier of $10 per index point movement.Equity options traded on CBOE also have a standard contract size of 100 shares; however their index options have varying amounts for the index multiplier dependent on the underlying index. Factors Influencing Option Price and ValueThere are several factors that affect the value and price of an option. When investing directly in an equity the trader’s only concern is price movement: did the share increase or decrease in price? The value of an option however depends on several factors: volatility intrinsic value movement of the underlying asset price expiry date interest rate changes and dividends.Volatility Volatility captures the variation in price expected in the underlying equity or in the case of index options the variation in the underlying index. The variation is measured by the standard deviation of returns; that is how much the price or index deviates from the mean. When an underlying equity asset is highly volatile the share price fluctuates widely increasing the chances that the anticipated price of the shares will be reached. The premium paid for the option is thus greater. When the implied volatility is low the price for the underlying equity is predicted to be reasonably constant and the premium paid for the option will be less. As implied volatility increases the value of both calls and puts increases and as implied volatility decreases option values decrease accordingly. The ASX and CBOE each have real-time volatility indices (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The ASX has the A-VIX which reflects expectations about volatility in Australia’s equity index the S&P/ASX 200 VIX. The CBOE tracks the Volatility Index (VIX) which is based on the S&P 500 Index. Both the A-VIX and the VIX provide insight to expectations of market volatility and the sentiment of futures traders. The A-VIX has a strong negative correlation (inverse relationship) with the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index (see Exhibit 3) and is therefore a useful tool for assessing the market trend and anticipated changes in volatility.Intrinsic Value The intrinsic value of an option is largely dependent on the strike price set in the option.If on August 19 2016 when the market price of CBA was $73.50 a trader took a long call position on CBA stock with a strike price of $65.00 the intrinsic value of the option would have been $8.50 (the difference between the market and strike prices). When a share price on the market is greater than the strike price in a call option (as in this example) the option is said to be “in the money” (ITM). Option buyers pay a high premium for this valuable option.If on the same day another trader took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $73.50 the current market price and the strike price would be the same. This call option would be considered to be “at the money” (ATM). ATM options have no intrinsic value but because the market price is almost certainly going to change over time ATM options have the greatest time value. A premium for an ATM option is usually less than the premium for an ITM option. In the final scenario if yet another a trader on the same day took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $75.00 the current market price would be less than the strike price. When the strike price is higher than the market price the call option is said to be “out of the money” (OTM). OTM options have no intrinsic value and have a smaller chance of success than ITM or ATM options. OTM options require the most price movement in the underlying asset to be ITM. The premium on an OTM option is significantly less than the premiums for ITM and ATM options. Therefore the advantage to buying an OTM option is the potential even if small for a significant return on a very low premium. Movement of the Underlying Asset PriceThe price movements of the underlying asset play a key role in determining the value of an option. If the price of the underlying asset is increasing the value of a call option (the opportunity to buy the underlying asset at a fixed lower price) increases and the value of a put option (the opportunity to sell the underlying asset at a below market price) decreases. When the price of an underlying asset is decreasing the opposite is true: the value of call options decreases and the value of put options increases.Expiry DateThe more time there is before an option expires the greater the chance the option will end ITM. Time decay (decline in the opportunity to become profitable) has the greatest negative impact on the value of an option. Typically an option loses one-third of its time value in the first half of its life and the remaining two-thirds of time value in its second half. An OTM option approaching expiry will suffer the greatest drop in value. Interest Rate Changes Interest rate changes have a small but measurable impact on option prices. When interest rates increase call premiums increase and put premiums decrease. This occurs because call buyers have the right to purchase the underlying asset at any time up to expiry; until they decide to exercise their option (or not) call buyers can invest their funds at higher yielding risk-free rates. Call buyers in this case are earning income while holding the option. Put prices decrease because put buyers have the right to sell the underlying asset any time up to maturity. They are holding the underlying asset so do not have the ability to invest their funds at higher risk-free rates. Traders in this case have the benefit of purchasing put options at a lower premium.DividendsOption prices are affected by anticipated dividends to be paid on the underlying asset within the option’s term (i.e. before expiry). The general consensus is that when a dividend is paid out on a stock the share price will drop in proportion to the dividend paid. Therefore if a dividend of an underlying asset increases during the term of the option the value of the underlying asset will likely decrease before the option expires. This affects the option’s premium: call premiums decrease and put premiums increase. (When assessing the impact of dividends it is important to remember that a share’s ex-dividend date—the date when a declared dividend belongs to the holder of the stock—is usually earlier than the date the dividend payment will be made.)Option Value Sensitivity MeasuresDelta is a sensitivity measure comparing the change in an option’s price to the change in the price of the underlying asset. We can estimate the likely change in an option’s price by multiplying the underlying asset price change by the option’s delta. Delta also infers the intrinsic value of an option and constantly changes with price movements in the underlying asset.All call options have a delta range of zero to one. A delta below 0.5 implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly 0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta above 0.5 implies the option is ITM.All put options have a delta range of zero to negative one. A delta above −0.5 (approaching zero) implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly −0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta below −0.5 (approaching negative one) implies the option is ITM.Vega is also a sensitivity measure. It measures the impact of changes in the underlying asset’s volatility on the option’s price. The vega of an option represents the amount that an option’s contract changes in relation to a 1 per cent change in the underlying asset’s volatility.Besides delta and vega there are other “Greeks” measuring option sensitivities. For example theta measures the change in an option’s price as the number of days until expiration decreases; theta is usually measured by one day. Rho measures an option’s change in premium if interest rates move by a specified percentage. Gamma measures the option’s delta change if the underlying asset moves by a specified percentage. (Further information on options Greeks is available on ASX’s website.)Options at ExpirationWhen an option expires—which for monthly single stock contracts listed on the ASX is every Thursday before the last Friday of the month and on the CBOE is the third Friday of the month—the option holder faces three alternatives: exercise the option sell the option or roll the option into another option if the held option is ATM or ITM. If the held option is OTM at expiration the option expires worthless. Tree diagrams demonstrate the call and put option holder’s choices at expiration (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Market Participants Options market participants include hedgers speculators arbitrageurs and market makers. Hedgers use options to reduce the risks associated with market uncertainty. Speculators use options to leverage into a position to capture gains based on the direction they believe a market is going. Arbitrageurs exploit imperfections and inefficiencies in the market often at very high speeds to make money. Market makers trade volatility (vega) as opposed to market movements (delta). Traders normally fall into the categories of hedgers or speculators. Brokers and dealers represent investors and place orders on their behalf for execution on the exchange (central market).There are four types of trades that an options market participant can make:Buy a call.Sell a call.Buy a put.Sell a put.Option holders called buyers or takers can choose whether or not to exercise the option. These participants could be hedging their current shareholdings from price risk or they could be investing in these leveraged derivatives to get greater exposure to the predicted price movement in their underlying asset. Losses for option holders are limited to the premium paid for the option (if the option expires OTM); however option holders have the potential to earn unlimited profits if the option expires ITM.Option providers called sellers or writers provide option holders with the right to exercise the option. That means that option providers are obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset if the holder decides to exercise the option. Thus option providers limit their profit to the premium received for providing the option; however they have potentially unlimited losses if the option expires ITM (with the market price higher than the strike price). For this reason option sellers are required to lodge a margin to ensure they can meet their obligations if an undesirable outcome occurs. Exhibits 6 7 8 and 9 provide profit and payoff diagrams of the four options trades. The four trade types when combined in different ways create different strategies for trading options.ANALYSESAn options trader needs to be able to make a market prediction and set an investment goal before selecting a trading strategy.Market Prediction: What do you think will occur in the future?An options trader must first predict what will happen to an underlying asset over a given period. Most traders will use some type of analysis whether it be fundamental or technical to determine what they believe will happen to an underlying asset whether a stock or an index. The analysis should consider when and over what period of time the underlying asset is expected to move. For example a trader’s prediction may be linked to a type of planned market announcement such as company results or to a piece of economic news such as a change to the reserve bank cash rate.Once the investment period and expected price movement are calculated traders need to add their own (or their investors’) risk profiles to the decision to decide what strike price and maturity to use within an options strategy. It is fair to say that the more a trader risks the more a strategy will return.Investment Goal: What are you trying to accomplish using options?Knowing what is wanted from an investment will reduce the number of option strategies to those appropriate for reaching the desired goal. An investor may want to protect the value of held shares in the event the market goes down or an investor may want to earn extra income from held stocks while markets are flat. To illustrate these goals assume the market analysis indicates stock XYZ will rise 2 per cent in the next four months (the prediction) and the investor wants to earn extra income (the goal). A trader could sell a 102 per cent strike call option with a maturity of four months meaning the option holder can purchase the investor’s shares at 102 per cent of their value at any point during or at the end of the four months. The prediction is that the investor will not have to sell the shares (because the market and strike price are the same) and the investor earns the premium paid by the option buyer. However if the analysis is slightly out—say for example the investor’s stock goes up 2.5 per cent—the option holder will exercise the option to purchase the shares and the investor will need to deliver them meaning the investor will have sold the stock at a loss. If the trader was writing a call option to gain income on a stock position this would not be the desired result. To reduce the risk of the option being exercised (also called “assigned”) and keep the underlying stock the trader may want to consider writing a call option with a shorter maturity date (three months) or a higher strike price (103 per cent) or possibly both. In either case the option premium would be less.Tools for AnalysisTraders now have multiple tools they can use to analyze option strategies and choose which are the best to use under certain conditions. An example of one of these tools is the ASX/TradeFloor options trading simulator which was developed to help first-time options traders understand how options work. Within this application traders can review stocks they are interested in build different option strategies based on their views of where an underlying asset may trade in the future and manage their portfolios. The application allows traders to investigate the payoffs and risk profiles of using different strategies while also allowing the trader to see how a particular risk profile of a given strategy changes when using different strike prices and maturities.Fundamental AnalysisFundamental analysis involves evaluating the intrinsic value of a company. It involves the use of balance sheets financial reports cash flow statements public announcements earnings reports and all publicly available information to establish an opinion about the direction and outlook of the company. There are numerous methods for determining a fair share value; that value can then be compared to the current market price which in turn signals the direction of price movement. Earnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) provides information about the earnings attributable to each outstanding share. This ratio is easily calculated by dividing a company’s net profit after tax by its total number of shares outstanding. Traders prefer an EPS to be growing at a consistent rate which suggests a bullish outlook while a decreasing ratio implies a bearish outlook. Price to Earnings RatioThe price to earnings (P/E) ratio provides information about a company’s growth prospects and indicates whether the company’s shares are currently over under or fairly priced. The ratio is calculated by dividing the share’s current market price by its EPS. In isolation the P/E ratio is meaningless; for meaningful information a company’s P/E ratio needs to be compared to that of a similar company. The P/E growth (PEG) ratio further aids in determining whether an equity is under- or overpriced. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected rate of growth in EPS. A PEG ratio close to 2 suggests that the stock is overpriced and a PEG ratio of 1 suggests the stock may be fair value. DividendsWhen analyzing a company the trader must determine whether the company pays a regular dividend on the equity. A dividend that is maintained or increased from the previous year signals to the market that the company is in good financial health. A dividend that is reduced signals that the company does not have sufficient profits each year to pay its shareholders. To calculate a dividend per share ratio divide the sum set aside for dividends by the number of shares outstanding.Dividend yield is a good method for comparing dividends paid out from companies in similar industries. To calculate dividend yield divide the dividend payout per share by the current share price. Companies with growing dividend yields suggest a bullish outlook and companies with decreasing yields suggest a bearish outlook. Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) provides information about how well a company is using shareholders’ funds. This ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s after-tax profit by the shareholders’ equity. A high ROE suggests that management is making good use of shareholders’ funds while a low ROE suggests the contrary.Earnings ReportsIt is essential to know when companies are due to release any earnings reports or announcements. These releases can have a profound effect on share price. If a company were to report mass losses for a quarter the information could initiate a massive sell-off in the market which would cause a large drop in share price. Alternatively the company could publish profits higher than expected which would cause an increased demand for the company’s shares and hence a rise in share price. Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis consists of studying past market data specifically the price and volume to predict future price direction. There are a vast number of technical indicators that traders use to forecast price movements. In this note we will focus on the use of trend lines Bollinger bands moving average convergence divergence and relative strength indicators to evaluate a company.Trend Lines Trend lines are highly suggestive of the direction a stock price will move. Support and resistance lines are established for the desired period of time: the support line illustrates the lowest price traders believe the share will fall to and the resistance line indicates the highest share price traders believe the share will earn. Technical analysts believe that a share will trade between the two lines and that the price is unlikely to fall below a support line or rise above the resistance line. Analysts believe that if a resistance or support line is broken once it is broken the share price will continue in the direction of the breakout requiring a new resistance or support line to be established (see Exhibit 10).There are numerous patterns that technical analysts seek with trend lines (see Exhibits 11 and 12 for uptrend and downtrend respectively). An ascending triangle occurs when an up-trending support line approaches a flat resistance line. This suggests the share may well make a sharp move upward for an explosive breakout. A descending triangle where the down-trending resistance line approaches a flat support line signals the opposite—a large price drop (see Exhibit 13 for a descending trend line). Bollinger Bands Bollinger bands are used to establish a share’s short-term prices. The indicator is created by plotting the average predetermined number of prices. Two trading bands are then added representing the standard deviation of the share price one band above (the highest price) and the other below (the lowest price) the centre line. Simply adding and subtracting one standard deviation from the moving average creates the outer bands. Under normal market conditions the price of a security will trade within the bands. The bands will expand as the share price becomes more volatile and contract as volatility decreases.Bollinger bands help establish common trends. Periods of high volatility (expansion) tend to follow periods of low volatility (contraction). When the price of a share crosses the upper Bollinger band analysts believe the share is overbought and the price is due for a correction with a drop (a pullback). When the price crosses the lower band analysts believe the security is oversold and a price correction back up to its true value (rally back) is imminent (see Exhibit 14).Moving Average Convergence DivergenceMoving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator that analysts use to establish a buy or sell signal. MACD illustrates the relationship between two moving price averages. The MACD is the result of subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A 9-day EMA of the MACD termed a signal line is then plotted on top of the MACD. When the MACD falls below the signal line it is a bearish signal. When the MACD rises above the signal line it is a bullish signal (see Exhibit 15). Relative Strength IndicatorA relative strength indicator (RSI) is also a momentum indicator; it compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to gauge the speed and change of a share’s price movements. RSI is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. If RSI values cross above 70 it is believed that the security is overbought and due for a pullback in price. If the RSI values cross below 30 the share is believed to be oversold and a price increase is due (see Exhibit 16).Option StrategiesThere are many option strategies available for varying market conditions. We will analyze a select few strategies for bullish bearish neutral and event-driven situations. It is important to understand the risks involved with trading options. Buying an option with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset will increase limits the buyer’s potential loss to the premium paid for the option. Providing or writing an option however exposes the trader to the potential of unlimited losses; for that reason the provider must have a margin account containing collateral. To analyze the selected strategies we will focus on the construction margin requirement market outlook and profit and loss of the strategies. For the purpose of explanation a hypothetical strike prices has been added for the following strategies. Bullish ViewBullish strategies do better in a rising market. They usually involve buying call options and selling put options to benefit from increasing asset prices.Long Call (see Exhibit 6)When a trader expects the price of the underlying stock to rise the bought call can provide leveraged exposure to the price increase. Buying a call also locks in a maximum purchase price for the life of the option.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will rise above A; volatility increasing.Profit: Unlimited profit potential if share price continues to rise (see Exhibit 6). Loss: Limited to premium paid.Break-even: Share price = strike price + premium paid.Intuition: Share price will rise above A; the call option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Effect of time decay works against the buyer of the call. If the expected rise in share price does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will erode the value of the option. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the cost of the option against the rise in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest rise in share price. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the best balance of risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for the share price to rise and will be more expensive than a shorter-term option. The trader needs to decide when and over what period of time the share price is expected to move. If the rise in share price takes place as expected the option buyer must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not rise as expected it is often advisable to exercise the option (“close out the position”) and recover some time value on the investment. If the option is ITM when it expires the trader must choose whether to sell the option or exercise it. The choice will be determined by whether the trader wants to own the underlying shares.Bull Call SpreadIf the trader is not bullish enough to buy a call outright but expects the share price to rise moderately the bull spread is a lower-cost way to gain exposure to such a market movement. The strategy consists of the simultaneous purchase of a call option (“long leg of the spread”) and sale of a call option with a higher strike price (“short leg of the spread”) but with the same expiration date.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A and sell a call at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish; market price to rise; volatility steady to rising.Profit: Limited to the difference between A and B (spread) less the premium paid for the spread.Loss: Limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = lower strike price + cost of spread.Intuition: Bought call A will be ATM (hence costly); therefore sell an OTM call with higher strike price B to receive a premium that reduces the overall cost of the strategy.Other points of consideration:The bull spread has limited risk and limited reward. It is a cheaper strategy than simply buying a call option. As a result the profit potential is reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is worth the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting will be greater for this strategy than when buying a call outright.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the option will cost money; however if the stock is trading around the higher strike price the option will make money.If the stock unexpectedly rises sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the upper strike price is reached. Although time value is helpful around the strike price of the short call unwinding the strategy early removes the risk that the short call will be exercised. If the stock price falls suddenly the spread may be unwound before the long call loses too much time value.Consider the bull spread when expecting a limited rise in the price of the stock. Do not enter the call options separately (“leg in” to the strategy). Enter the trade as a spread and unwind it as a spread. Bearish ViewBearish strategies work best in falling markets. Bearish strategies generally rely on buying put options to lock in selling prices as asset prices decrease.Long Put (see Exhibit 8)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to fall the bought put provides leveraged exposure to the price fall. Buying a put option is one of the few ways traders can speculate on a falling share price. Put options may also be used to protect an investor’s holding in the underlying stock.Construction: Buy one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to fall below A; volatility rising.Profit: Limited to strike price less premium paid for the option (see Exhibit 8).Loss: Limited to premium paid for the option.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium paid.Intuition: Share price will drop below strike price A; the put option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Time decay works against the buyer of the put. If the expected share price fall does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option. When setting the strike price the trader must balance the cost of the option against the fall in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest fall in share price. If the trader is buying a put to protect a shareholding the cost of the option must be weighed against the required protection. The ITM option locks in the highest sale price for the underlying shares but is also the most expensive option.If the fall in share price takes place as expected the put option taker must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not fall as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to recover some time value.At expiry the holder of an ITM put option will usually close out rather than exercise the position (unless the holder owns the underlying shares). If the put has been bought to protect a shareholding the trader must decide whether to continue holding the stock in which case the put would be sold or sell the shares in which case the option would be exercised.Short Call (see Exhibit 9)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to go down the sold call can provide leveraged exposure to the price reduction. Selling a call does not limit the trader’s potential loss so it carries a greater risk profile than purchasing a put.Construction: Sell one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bearish; share price will go below strike price A; volatility neutral to reducing.Profit: Maximum profit is premium received for providing the option (see Exhibit 9).Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received. Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed.Other points of consideration:Time decay works for the seller of the call. If the expected share price reduction does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option to the seller’s advantage. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the premium received on the option against the reduction in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will obtain the lowest premium but also carries the lowest chance of loss. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the highest risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for a reduction in the share price to take place. It will generate a higher premium but it carries a greater risk of the market moving against the trader. The trader needs to identify the time period over which the share price movement is expected to take place. If the share price reduction takes place as expected the call option taker will normally not exercise the option. However if the stock price is ATM or ITM and the taker exercises the option the writer must deliver the stock.If the share price does not reduce as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to remove the risk of assignment if not already holding the underlying shares. This is called a “naked” position since you hold an option on shares you do not own and would have to acquire these shares if the option were exercised. Assignment risk brings the uncertainty associated with the pricing and timing of acquiring the shares before you can sell them.  Bear Put SpreadThe bear spread can be considered when the trader expects a moderate fall in the market but is not prepared to take a put position outright. The strategy consists of the purchase of a put option (“long leg”) and the sale of a put option with a lower strike price (“short leg”).Construction: Sell one put at strike price A and buy one put at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to expire below strike price A; volatility steady to increasing.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the difference between A and B (the spread) less the premium paid.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = upper strike − cost of spread.Intuition: Purchased put B will be ATM—hence fairly costly. Therefore sell an OTM put with a lower strike price A to receive a premium which decreases the total net cash outlay. Once the share price drops below strike price A the profit is capped. (A short position creates a loss; however this is counterbalanced by the purchased put being deep ITM.)Other points of consideration:The bear spread has limited risk and limited reward. It costs less to place than an outright purchase of a put option. As a result the potential for profit is also reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is justified by the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting can significantly reduce profitability.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the impact of time decay will be positive and you will make money due to the strategy; if the stock is trading around the higher strike it will cost money to hold the strategy.If the stock unexpectedly falls sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the lower strike price is reached. Time decay will benefit the spread around the lower strike price; however the trader will usually be more concerned with avoiding exercise on the short leg.If the stock price rises suddenly the spread may be unwound before the taken put loses too much time value.Use the bear spread when you are expecting a limited fall in the underlying stock. Do not leg in to this strategy; rather trade both options at the same time. Neutral ViewNeutral strategies work best in stagnant markets. They often involve balancing the purchase and sale of both call and put options to take advantage of any changes in underlying asset prices.Short Put (see Exhibit 7)The written put can provide the trader with extra income in flat to rising markets. It can also be used as a way to buy stock cheaply. This strategy is generally used when the trader expects the share price to remain steady or increase slightly over the life of the option.Construction: Sell one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will expire above A; volatility falling.Profit: Limited to premium received (see Exhibit 7).Loss: Maximum loss equals strike price A less premium received.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received.Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed. Other points of consideration:Many traders write put options as a way of buying stock cheaply. If the share price falls and the option is exercised the purchase price is effectively the strike price of the option less the premium received which is less than the price of the stock at the time of writing the option. If the share price at expiry is above the strike price the option will expire worthless. The trader does not get to buy the stock but has benefited from the receipt of the premium. Time decay works in favour of the put writer. If the stock price stays steady the ATM option will deliver the most profit to the put writer because this is the option with the most time value. The put writer must be wary of exercising the option too early. Generally a put option is more likely than a call option to be exercised early. This strategy can result in heavy losses if the share price falls significantly. Puts should only be written if the seller has the financial capacity to buy the underlying shares should the option be exercised. Monitor the position closely. An ITM option will need to be closed to avoid exercise. Short StraddleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short straddle may be considered. This strategy has a higher potential profit than the short strangle; however it offers less protection since the share price remains within a tighter price range in order to profit. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Sell one call at A and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Neutral; share price will expire around A; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit limited to combined premium received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium received.Intuition: The break-even point for the sold call A is the strike price plus the premium received. For the sold put A the break-even point is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader expects the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option to expire worthless and the premiums received to be pocketed. Other points of consideration:The straddle yields higher potential profit than the strangle because of the higher premiums received for writing ATM options. However the strategy provides less protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price does not have to move as much before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. The short straddle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. There is high risk of early exercise on one of the written options making up the straddle because both the call and the put have the same exercise price. Unless the stock price closes at the strike level set in the options one of the options will be ITM and more than likely be exercised.The options trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down (by increasing or decreasing the strike prices in one of the options) thereby creating a strangle.Because the potential is for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. Do not choose distant expiry months. Short StrangleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short strangle may be considered. This strategy has a lower potential profit than the short straddle; however it offers greater protection because the share price must move further to cause a loss. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Sell one call at B and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: The option will expire between strike prices A and B; volatility falling.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the combined premiums received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium received; Share price = lower strike − premium received.Intuition: The intuition for the short straddle also applies here. The difference is that with the short strangle both options have distinctive strike prices. This extends the spread (bounds) within which the trader expects the share price to remain. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while the short straddle is better in a less volatile environment. Other points of consideration:The strangle yields lower potential profit than the straddle because the premiums are lower for writing OTM options. However the strategy provides better protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price has to move further before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. As with the short straddle the short strangle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options there is a lower risk of early exercise than for the straddle. However a dramatic change in the share price can bring one of the options ITM thereby introducing the risk of exercise. The option trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. By taking protection the short strangle is transformed into another strategy known as a “long condor.” If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down thereby maintaining the strangle. The trader should always be aware that although the short strangle is a more defensive strategy than the short straddle a sudden and extreme change in volatility can be very damaging.Because of the potential for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. A trader should use the short strangle over the short straddle if there are any doubts about the market’s neutrality. Do not choose expiry months that are too distant. Long ButterflyThe long butterfly can be used to generate extra income when the trader believes the market is stagnating but does not want to be exposed to an unexpected rise or fall. The strategy consists of buying one ITM and one OTM call and writing two ATM calls.Construction: Buy one call at A sell one call and one put at B and buy one put at C.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Neutral; market price will expire around B; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit will occur at strike price B.Break-even: Share price = lowest strike price (A) + the cost of strategy; Share price = central strike price (B) − the cost of strategy.Loss: The maximum loss is limited to the premiums paid for the strategy.Other points of consideration:The maximum profit from the long butterfly will be earned if the market finishes at the middle strike price when the options expire. In this case only the lower strike price call will finish ITM. Accordingly the trader will profit on the difference between the middle and lower strike prices less the cost of the spread. Most of this profit will develop in the last month as time decay accelerates. The most the trader can lose is the cost of the spread which will occur if the market finishes out past either “wing” of the long butterfly.The presence of short options in the strategy means that an increase in the market price above the central strike price introduces the risk of exercise. The long butterfly can be difficult to place in all but the most liquid stocks. The ATM options that are required on both sides are often thinly traded (exchanged in low volumes with limited interested traders) making the strategy difficult and sometimes costly to set up and trade out. In these circumstances the reward may not justify the effort of entering the position. If the share price remains steady the position may be left until close to expiry since the profit develops almost entirely in the last month.If the share price moves sharply up the trader may consider liquidating the position in order to avoid exercise. If the share price moves sharply down the trader may close out in order to salvage some time value from the taken options in the strategy.Be sure the rewards are sufficient to justify establishing the strategy in the first place. Do not use this strategy on thinly traded stocks. Enter the position with at least a month until expiry.Event Driven (Price Break Out)Long StraddleWhen the trader expects a sharp movement in the share price but is unsure of the direction the movement will take the long straddle may be appropriate. The strategy consists of buying a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Buy one call at A and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside; on the downside the maximum profit is limited to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium paid.Intuition: The break-even point for the bought call A is the strike price plus the premium received. The break-even for the bought put A is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader does not expect the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option value to increase. Other points of consideration:The bought straddle consists of two long positions. As a result time decay works strongly against the strategy. The longer the straddle is left in place the greater the loss due to time decay. The position must therefore be closely monitored and may need to be closed out well before expiry. The trader must balance the cost of the strategy against the time needed to give it the best chance of success. Distant expiry months will provide the strategy with more time; however longer-dated options will be more expensive than those with shorter dates. The taker of a straddle expects volatility in the market to increase. Only rarely will this strategy be held to expiry. If the trader’s market view proves correct the straddle should be unwound to crystallize the profits. The position can be liquidated on both sides simultaneously or if the OTM option has little value it could be left open in the event the market were to reverse.If volatility does not increase as expected the strategy should be unwound well ahead of expiry before time decay damages the position.Choose options over shares if the market is expected to remain or become volatile. Select an expiry month that gives the strategy time to work. Monitor the position closely and be prepared to unwind it well before expiry. Long StrangleWhen implied volatility is relatively low but the trader expects the stock price to make an explosive move buying a strangle may be appropriate. The strangle is cheaper than the straddle; however a larger move in the share price is required for the strangle to be profitable. The strategy consists of buying a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Buy one call at B and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium; Share price = lower strike − premium.Intuition: The intuition for the long straddle also applies to the long strangle. The difference is that both options have distinctive strike prices which broadens the spread (bounds) that the trader expects the share price to exceed. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while long straddle is more beneficial in a less volatile environment.Other points of consideration:As with the long straddle the long strangle is exposed to time decay. Since both options are OTM they consist entirely of time value. As expiry approaches time decay accelerates. For this reason the strangle is generally unwound well before expiry. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options it costs less than the straddle. The disadvantage is that the share price must move further for the strategy to be profitable. The trader must be expecting a significant move for the long strangle to be considered. If the expected increase in volatility or change in share price is not achieved both options will expire worthless.The strangle should not be held too close to expiry. If the expected move in the share price has taken place the position can usually be unwound at a profit well before expiry. If the stock’s direction becomes clear it may be appropriate to close out the option that is losing its value and continue to hold the profitable option.If the expected increase in volatility does not take place it may be advisable to close the position out before time decay starts to damage the strategy.Choose options over shares when the share price is expected to move strongly in either direction. Always be aware of the effects of time decay and do not hold the position too close to expiry. Choose expiry months that allow enough time for the underlying shares to move. ALTERNATIVES TO TRADING OPTIONSThere are a number of alternative products that can be used by traders to obtain a leveraged investment profile similar to that of options. These products include warrants futures and contracts for difference (CFDs).In order to compare the appropriateness of using an option instead of an alternative product the trader needs to consider the following questions:What is the delta exposure of the product and does this change?Can I write (short) the product?Is margin charged and if so to whom?Is the product traded on exchange or over the counter (OTC)?Who issues the product?How is the market price determined?WarrantsWarrants are very similar to options in that they have rights but not obligations to purchase or sell an underlying product at a given date. Warrants can also have varying degrees of delta just like options. However warrants are issued by companies either on exchange or OTC as opposed to exchange-traded options (ETOs) which are listed by the exchange. Traders cannot write warrants like they can options. Warrants normally have longer expiries than options. The issuer (or appointed market maker) of the warrant product is the only one allowed to write meaning the issuer dictates the price. Options allow all participants to buy and sell creating a more efficient market. Because warrants can only be purchased they do not require a margin to be lodged. ETOs also do not require a margin to be lodged if purchasing but they do require a margin if selling. FuturesFutures are highly leveraged products that give users the ability to hedge or speculate on price movements of an underlying product. The primary difference between options and futures is that an options contract contains the right to buy or sell the underlying asset; equity futures on the other hand are traditionally cash settled at expiry. Futures are a delta one product whereas options have a delta range of between minus one and one. Margins are required to be lodged against futures positions for both the long and short holder of the contract and this can change daily. For options only the seller is required to post a margin. Both futures and options are listed on exchanges and the market users set the prices. However in Australia retail access to trade futures is limited to available brokers as compared to traders’ access to options.CFDsA CFD is a varied futures style product that gives the holder delta one exposure to the underlying asset. The contract normally settles a cash amount between the buyer and seller daily based on the change to the value of the underlying asset over the day. This is separate from a daily change in margin. CFDs are traditionally highly leveraged and require margins to be posted. CFDs are traditionally traded on an OTC market where the market price is ultimately determined by the CFD provider. This can on occasion lead to variations in price from the true underlying market price. The cost for trading CFDs is normally less than for options and futures listed on a traditional exchange. A trader should be mindful though that CFDs are not suitable for a buy-and-hold strategy due to the daily interest changes being applied to the trader’s account based on the notional exposure. It is also important to note that the risks associated with CFDs are higher due to the less stringent regulatory framework in which CFD product providers operate.Considering the above options provide traders with greater flexibility than competing products. Options not only allow traders the ability to trade underlying movement (delta) but also volatility (vega). What this equates to is a marketplace where the buyer and seller can both benefit from a trade. In addition the strategies discussed earlier in the note can only be achieved using different combinations of options and this ultimately enables traders to achieve a better risk–return profile and a closer match to their goals for investment. EVALUATIONBefore implementing any strategy traders must determine what they think the market is going to do over a given period of time. Once the prediction is established traders can implement a corresponding strategy based on the market outlook for the respective equity (or index) to exploit the expected condition. Understanding how the respective market index is calculated and making use of the tools outlined above greatly increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. In Australia the companies listed on S&P/ASX 200 are ranked based on market capitalization. The top 20 listed companies will affect the movement of the S&P/ASX 200 index more than the other companies. As previously noted the A-VIX is inversely correlated to the S&P/ASX 200. The A-VIX exhibits mean reversion (i.e. oscillates around a long-term average); hence a trader can try to predict where the market is heading and further anticipate the general direction of the top 20 equities that will cause the most likely trend. When implementing investment strategies traders must choose the strike price spread size and maturity month for the options. Strike prices are set according to the desired outcome; their intrinsic value is a key determinant in the premium paid. On a spread trade (where several calls and puts are employed) the respective option strike price creates the boundaries in which a trader expects the underlying asset to remain (or exceed). The majority of options are traded in the short term with outlooks of a month or two primarily because there is more certainty over the short term about an anticipated underlying trend. There are numerous online calculators that check the risk and potential profitability of an option’s position. The calculators make use of a simple Monte Carlo simulator that allows the trader to enter the current underlying asset market price the target price days remaining to expiry and the annual volatility percentage (from the respective volatility index). The results provide traders with information about the probability of the underlying asset being above or below the target price.Prior to implementing any strategy traders need to outline and understand the associated costs risks potential profit potential losses and potential impact of time decay on the strategy. The long call long put bull call spread bear put spread long straddle and long strangle are low-cost strategies that require no margin are easy to implement and provide the desired leveraged exposure to the underlying asset. The short call short put short strangle long butterfly and short straddle all require margin accounts because the risk involved with these strategies is higher. CONCLUSIONOptions trading strategies can result in great returns and can achieve a much better tailored risk profile than alternative products. An entry-level trader can use strategies that do not include margins are low cost and are relatively easy to implement. In order to be successful and achieve the best outcome traders must do the required pre-investment analysis and understand the factors that affect the value of the options.EXHIBIT 1: INDEX PRICES FOR S&P/ASX 200 VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 2: INDEX PRICES FOR THE CHICAGO BOARD OPTIONS EXCHANGE VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 3: INDEX PRICES FOR THE S&P/ASX 200 INDEX VERSUS A-VIXSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 4: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING CALL OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 5: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING PUT OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.

Ltd. (Midea Group) He Xiangjian (He) retired as board chairman to focus solely on Midea Group’s holding company. This was He’s second voluntary retreat from a chairmanship: in 2009 He had handed over the chairman position of Guangdong Midea Electric Appliances Co. Ltd. (Midea EA) a former listed company controlled by Midea Group before the group’s overall listing in 2013. Midea Group was a white goods empire built by He over decades and the Midea brand led the home appliance industry. He’s successor was Fang Hongbo a 45-year-old professional manager and the former chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Midea EA. Fang faced a grim situation as he took over the position: business performance was plummeting Midea Group was urgently in need of a strategic transformation senior management would likely resist taking orders from Fang and at a basic level the organization was overstaffed and ineffective. In addition many senior managers felt that He’s son would have been a better choice as successor to his father according to Chinese cultural traditions.Fang was worried about how to handle his new position. His duties would be much heavier than those he had faced after becoming chairman of Midea EA in 2009. He knew that even if he did his utmost for Midea Group’s growth he might not be able to count on the allegiance of all of its senior managers who had been equally competitive in the successor contest. If they did not listen to—or deliberately sabotaged—Fang’s commands his leadership could lead to adverse business results and wild accusations. Fang reflected and came to a grave realization: “Only hard operating data is convincing enough. It is high time the old operating model was changed. Changing business operations while keeping key staff stabilized will be challenging [but it is] imperative for Midea Group to thrive in the future.”Before THE SuccessionHe Xiangjian Founder of Midea GroupBorn in 1942 He was the founder of Midea Group. Before founding the company He was an undereducated but sophisticated serial entrepreneur struggling to fit into a social system that did not acknowledge private businesses or market economy. After China’s market was reformed and opened up in 1978 his business shifted from producing fan parts to producing fans and then air conditioners. In 1993 Midea EA went public as the first private listed company transformed from collective ownership in China. From 1990 to 1994 Midea EA was among the top three companies in China in terms of air conditioner sales. Building Business UnitsIn the 1990s every competitor in the white goods market tried to bring down opponents by executing significant price cuts; most firms stumbled with across-the-board losses. In 1996 Midea EA’s air conditioner sales dropped to seventh place in the industry. The company’s only profits that year came from outside investment returns. In painful reflection He believed the root of this decline was bureaucracy. At that time Midea Group had built five product lines (mainly air conditioners fans and electric cookers) accounting for hundreds of product models. All operating decisions were centrally made by the headquarters and that caused inefficiency. In 1997 He decided to reform the organization into five business units (BUs)—namely air conditioners home appliances air compressors electric motors and kitchenware—and gave each unit a high degree of autonomy. Business relationships between BUs were market oriented and transactional. Meanwhile the company appointed several professional managers as heads of these BUs. For example Fang was in charge of domestic sales of Midea Group’s air conditioner BU. The head office mainly focused on overall strategic decision-making and management control. In order to clarify the boundaries of power and responsibility Midea Group laid out principles in a “Manual of Power.” This became the foundation of many future structural changes.Taking the opportunity to enact organizational reform and power decentralization He persuaded some founding members of Midea Group (including his wife) to retire early and purposely reduced family influence in the company. He also retired from most daily operations. Young professional managers replaced old ones in key positions soon after. Since 1997 Midea Group’s executive team had only professional managers and no family members. He believed that talent was naturally attracted to the organization because of “appropriate incentives power separation and accountability systems in place.” However after decades of a centrally planned social system China did not have a mature talent market especially for professional managers. In fact almost all of Midea Group’s newly appointed managers were promoted from within.Fang Hongbo’s Career in Midea GroupIn 1992 25-year-old Fang joined Midea Group as an editor of the corporate magazine working in the president’s office. His talent was recognized by He who promoted Fang repeatedly over the next five years (see Exhibit 1). Fang recalled “I do feel he was purposely mentoring me. He often called me to his office and took out a small piece of paper full of things that he recorded about me. He would specifically talk to me about some of my indiscretions he saw including a bad speech or impulsive reflexes.” In 1997 He promoted Fang to oversee Midea EA’s biggest business—domestic sales of air conditioners. Most of the company’s senior managers objected to this appointment but He insisted that he wanted Fang to execute his customer-oriented marketing philosophy and a flat channel system. Fang helped Midea EA’s air conditioner sales regain the number-three position the next year with a 200 per cent growth rate. His success impressed He who commented “What gratifies me more than anything else is not sales growth but being right in seeing the potential in young people.” After this first victory Fang was soon promoted to even higher positions (see Exhibit 1). The Problem of Countless SubculturesFrom 2000 onward nearly all home appliance manufacturers chose to prioritize rapid expansion; through mergers and acquisitions they aspired to build the world’s largest production lines seek product diversification and grow further. Fang recalled “In 2004 Midea Group did not have refrigerator or washer businesses. In only five years’ time Midea Group was already able to rival Haier Group Co. Ltd. the market leader at that time in the home appliance market.” Meanwhile Midea Group’s organizational structure became complicated. Management determined that the ultimate reason for repetitive investment and lack of synergy was due to the large number of BUs. In 2004 the group added a new management layer—so-called “secondary groups”—to oversee the BUs. He intended to make Midea Group an investment holding group. Some powers previously held by BUs were centralized to these secondary groups creating higher positions for professional managers. From this point onward Midea Group’s structure included four tiers: Midea Group secondary groups (such as the listed company Midea EA) 25 business divisions and product companies. Every tier had functional departments and staff; He believed that such a structure reflected the horizontal and vertical power balance.The 2009 Succession: The Listed CompanyRumour in 2004Around the end of 2004 it was rumoured that Midea EA’s board of directors was about to change. He’s only son He Jianfeng (Jianfeng) was expected to become a board member soon. This rumour collapsed when He announced a group restructuring plan in 2004 which actually gave two professional managers even more power. Yet the media quickly gathered evidence to support a new theory that Jianfeng was aiming for the chairman position of the overall group rather than that of the listed company Midea EA.He Jianfeng and Infore GroupJianfeng started his own business Infore Group (Infore) in 1994. Infore was primarily concerned with manufacturing products for Midea Group. By 2002 Infore had seven subsidiaries with more than 5000 employees. The firm was regarded by outsiders as a training ground that He had prepared for Jianfeng because if Jianfeng eventually intended to join Midea Group he would be faced with many senior executives who might dwarf him in business decisions. However Jianfeng chose not to follow his father’s path of home appliance manufacturing and instead declared that his company would pursue business opportunities in the capital market in 2008. He also had two daughters He Qianchang (QC the elder daughter) and He Qianxing (QX). He and his daughters invested in Infore. QC and QX were running a moulding company and a new materials company. Both daughters were undertaking upstream business in relation to Midea Group. Meanwhile QX also ran an electronic device company. He had long felt that “Midea Group was never a family business. The company needs professional managers to sustain future growth.” In 2009 after Jianfeng declared the strategic change for Infore Group He’s thoughts became more crystallized as he confidently stated “CEOs of the group will all be professional managers and my family will always stay in the role of shareholder.”Succession on the Fast TrackOn August 26 2009 He resigned as chairman and director of Midea EA. Fang then vice-chairman and CEO of the company succeeded He as chairman of the board. From then on the board of Midea EA contained no members of the He family. This was the point in time when Midea EA completely entered into a “professional manager era” as dubbed by many professional managers. Fang was not surprised by his appointment as chairman. Ten years before He had told him “You need to look beyond the current position and shoulder more responsibilities in the days to come.” Fang clearly remembered He changed his wording to be more concrete but without specifying a time: “In the future I will hand this over to you.” The handover of Midea EA was timely because Midea Group was experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. The company’s growth-oriented strategy led to revenues of over CN¥100 billion for the first time in 2010. At that exciting point in time He (who was 68 at the time) announced a five-year plan to “recreate a new Midea.” The new plan involved realizing ¥200 billion revenue by 2015. Employees and managers were excited about this goal and began to develop new business areas and projects. A senior executive recalled “We thought the ¥200 billion target could easily be achieved before 2015.”Business Downturn and Transformation EffortsSetback in ExpansionAt the end of the second quarter of 2011 Midea Group experienced some disturbing financial results. For example in the first quarter of 2011 Midea EA’s sales revenue grew by 59 per cent but net profit only increased by 13.7 per cent. Internal analyses concluded that actual market demand did not show substantial growth. Overstocking channels with inventory and conducting price-cutting campaigns effectively ballooned revenue figures but these measures inevitably undermined Midea Group’s profitability. In addition many projects had been hastened into operations to boost revenue levels. Midea EA Leads the TransformationMidea EA under Fang’s leadership was the first branch to transform within Midea Group. In the second half of 2011 Fang proposed a new product upgrade strategy: making premium products to boost prices and the Midea brand image. However it was hard for the whole management team to transform its old mindset of producing basic products and recklessly cutting prices. The inefficient and unprofitable businesses within Midea EA caused year-over-year (YoY) growth of revenue and profits to slow. As chairman and CEO Fang was able to close them (see Exhibit 2). In the first half of 2012 the number of product models decreased from 22000 to 15000. Fang remembered “It was like if you didn’t cut off the infected arm you’d lose your life.” From 2010 to 2011 Midea EA cut its 100000 employees by one-third. Fang also streamlined the channel system. At the peak of scale expansion Midea EA had distributors in every county in China. When China’s policy of “home appliances outreach to the countryside” stopped neither distributors nor Midea EA saw profits.Midea EA began to integrate channels and changed key performance indicators in accordance with the new strategy. In the previous performance measurement system profit was not as important as revenue which created a giant company that could not generate value to shareholders. Since 2012 it was required that profit growth must be higher than revenue growth so that profit margins would rise. New products that could generate higher margins were developed while many lines of low-price products were reduced. The company started declining large orders of low-profit products which was alarming to some managers who firmly believed that no order should be dismissed. The 2012 Succession: Midea GroupLargely due to the increased efforts in the second half of 2011 Midea EA’s operating profits jumped by 96 per cent although its YoY revenue growth dropped by 24.9 per cent (see Exhibit 2). He was satisfied with Fang’s success and began to contemplate how to turn around Midea Group as a whole. But Fang was worried: he knew that Midea Group was encountering a bottleneck after years of growth and expansion (see Exhibit 3). Fang felt that Midea Group needed a leader powerful enough to press the brakes find another direction and regain high speed soon afterward. He would be the perfect person for that role but Fang also knew that the role would involve reducing the interests of very senior people—something He would not feel comfortable doing on his own. The HandoverIn the summer of 2012 He’s idea of complete retirement from all positions in Midea Group came to fruition. He summoned key executives and asked them to discuss how they felt about Fang. On August 25 2012 He officially handed over the whole group to Fang the new board chairman. At the farewell meeting He made it clear to all that he no longer wanted to be involved in any “daily affairs and meetings.” The newly announced board of directors included Fang Jianfeng six other professional managers and two representatives from strategic investors. Fang and the other six directors had been at Midea Group since the 1990s and had all been promoted by He (see Exhibit 4). According to a former executive He had been monitoring professional managers’ personal performance for over 10 years assigning independent tasks to them and observing the results so that he could identify his ideal successor.Preparations for the HandoverOverall ListingBefore handing the Group over to Fang He planned for an overall listing; first Midea EA would be delisted then all other businesses under the Midea Group but formerly outside Midea EA would be combined to form a packaged portfolio which would be a new overall listing. The added businesses included small household appliances electric motors and logistics services. Midea Group became the largest listed white goods company in China’s domestic stock exchange market surpassing the market capitalization of Haier Group and Gree Electric Appliances Inc. Group RestructuringHe also restructured the group before handing it over to Fang. He dismantled the four secondary groups and split them into 15 product BUs. Many powers and resources were centralized in the head office to realize synergies in finance supply chains sales channels storage and other resources. The disappearing secondary groups had been on the same level as Midea EA. After Fang became group chairman the president of the home appliance group (Huang Jian) and the head of the electric motor group (Cai Qiwu) were appointed president and vice-president respectively reporting to Fang; both had seats on the board of directors. In a media report a previous employee suspected that there would be difficulties between Fang and these two heads: “When He was still the figurehead of the company the professional managers looked up to him and listened to him. Now they needed to learn how to live in harmony under the current power structure; after all their positions are no longer in parallel like before.” However these appointments paved the way for Fang giving him actual authority over the whole Midea Group. Fang quickly clarified Midea Group’s future organizational guideline: a small head office and an integrated system.Stock Ownership PlansMidea Group’s 2012 performance figures looked grim. Revenue was just over ¥100 billion meaning ¥30 billion in revenue had evaporated compared to the previous year. Fang knew that the senior executives’ mindset had to change immediately to facilitate the new operating model that he was calling for and he would need to convince these executives using hard numbers rather than wordy explanations. Fang also knew that appropriate incentive plans needed to be in place for the change in strategy to work. The incentive system needed to be oriented toward future growth rather than based on immediate financial performance. 2007: The First Stock Ownership PlanSince 2007 Midea Group had been trying to raise senior executives’ personal salaries to international standards to reward the executives’ contributions toward the company’s rapid growth in past years. A virtual stock ownership plan was developed covering seven core executives including all heads of secondary groups and several functional department heads. When Midea Group completed its overall listing in 2013 these executives immediately became very wealthy (see Exhibit 5). Only five of them remained at Midea Group. Midea Group’s compensation structure adopted a “low basic salary high performance salary” pattern. The year-end bonus could be five times as much as the basic monthly salary and the company mostly distributed bonuses in cash. Midea Group managers’ overall pay level was admired by their peers working for competing firms. One Midea executive commented “We worked [very hard] to achieve performance targets so that we could get the bonus but many business analysts thought we were pushing next year’s business ahead of time and this practice lacked sustainability.” The 2007 stock ownership plan did not cover BU general managers—not even for the biggest BU which had greater revenue than a secondary group.Meisheng Plan When Midea Group’s structure changed to encompass 15 BUs in 2012 the group initiated a new stock ownership plan the “Meisheng (MS) Plan” to cover 47 BU general managers deputy general managers and some departmental heads in the head office. These executives co-founded a partnership to purchase 3 per cent of the pre-listing equity of Midea Group (diluted to 1.75 per cent after overall listing) from Midea Group’s holding company at book value (see Exhibit 6). Because the executives could sell their shares at market price after a three-year lock-up period starting from September 18 2013 the actual personal income from the MS Plan could be remarkably high. As one executive understood it “[He] used his own money to motivate us and thus we were able to lead a decent life. The stock ownership plan supplemented the existing cash incentive system and urged managers to look seriously at long-term growth.”Future Stock Ownership PlansFang believed long-term incentives should be extended to middle management. In 2014 and every year afterward Fang planned to launch a new plan that might cover up to 1000 middle managers. Fang realized that such an incentive plan would not satisfy everyone and might even hurt some feelings but he decided that BU heads would have to be able to identify key talents and motivate them using long-term incentive tools. Challenges for Fang HongboFang was very sure of the direction that Midea Group’s transformation would take but there was no guarantee that the group’s financial results would rebound immediately. There were already doubts circulating throughout the company: what if things did not turn around soon? Fang tried to keep calm and resolute. He knew that selling unprofitable businesses and laying off employees could turn the group inside out so he decided to move quickly before employees started to raise questions based on speculation and rumour.Activating ManagersFang recognized a lack of willingness to learn new things among some managers. Many managers also resisted change. Fang analyzed their collective mindset: “It usually takes several years for a manager to be promoted to director. After that their personal growth stagnates. They resist learning new concepts like Internet-based business models. They form small circles protect members and do not work with others.” On many occasions Fang reiterated to managers how the company should change to conform to the new era (e.g. with respect to e-commerce and customer orientation). For those who did not want to follow Fang was clear and direct about the consequences: “At this critical point in time you either change or go. . . . Whoever you are no matter how senior you are I’ll remove you if you can’t follow my lead. I don’t care if this means I have to lose the chairman title because of this.” In fact after the head office BU restructuring Fang’s former competitors (the other former secondary group heads) were gradually deprived of most of their authority. Fang knew that he had disrupted many people’s equanimity by streamlining businesses and firing people. He believed that the moment he took over at Midea Group certain people had already secretly decided to leave. But there was no turning back. Fang had to boost performance results or else he would fall into a very difficult position with everyone turning on him. What was troubling for Fang was that even if the streamlining initiative did boost efficiency revenue would still drop in the short term. He also knew that his tough approach was in sharp contrast to He’s genial and easy-going style. Fang might not have been a “people person” but he tried to let everyone know that while he had high expectations of his staff members they should not take his attitude personally. To show his solidarity with the other employees Fang refused to use the exclusive elevator and private dining room for executives and started to take the ordinary elevator wait in lines and have lunch in the cafeteria like everyone else. Facing He XiangjianFang thought he had to report major changes to the board of directors. After 20 years of service He and Fang were almost like father and son. Would the succession change the nature of their relationship? He left enough power and space for Fang to do what he needed to do. In fact He only attended meetings to listen to Fang’s updates twice a year. Jianfeng also had a seat on the board but like his father he seldom gave feedback. However Fang thought he needed to guard against developing any arrogance and self-importance. He doubted that he needed to redefine his relationship with He as that of “agent and owner.” The trust between them needed to be solidified rather than sabotaged by doubts that could be triggered by unexpected events. Fang believed he needed to act as professionally as possible by reporting to He periodically even though he rarely offered feedback.Fang tried to analyze the subtleness of his relationship with He: “Our relationship had dozens of years of trust as its foundation. But every second after my succession it could go sour if I did not attend to [all necessary] details. It was not a blood relationship after all. It was much weaker as it was employment based in nature.” At the same time Fang realized that this relationship was stronger than those between other professional managers. He commented “I had followed [He] since the beginning. His every look every move and even how he put his hands—I knew exactly what he was thinking. No outside CEOs would be able to do this. I don’t think this succession case is replicable in the future.” This realization prompted Fang to think about the next generation of Midea Group’s leaders: “The situation between me and the next generation of leaders might be a lot different than what [developed] between He and me.”Fang sometimes asked himself why he was taking on this new role. His increased authority had isolated him from his peers. Performance pressures the resistant management team and his complex relationship with the He family were all heavy burdens for Fang. Excluding equity gains Fang’s nominal annual salary was only half that of his previous position. Fang knew he was driven by the need to repay He saying “If only driven by personal interest I would not be able to lead the company further. I was very grateful that [He] had dug me up and made me extraordinary.”Change in Top ManagementIn October 2013 the resignation of one BU president Huang Jian shook the whole company. Employees traded internal details about how fierce the power struggle was among top managers. In April 2014 senior vice-president Huang Xiaoming also resigned and in July of the same year Cai Qiwu followed. Huang took a new position in Midea Holding. Under China’s stock exchange rules if managers resigned their shares from the MS Plan were locked until September 18 2016. It struck Fang that every manager who had participated in the 2013 MS Plan would become very wealthy in 2016. He had to design a new plan to motivate them when that time came. The MS Plan based on He’s personal contribution was not sustainable. New sources of incentive shares needed to be in place. New Business DirectionHe assigned Fang a hard task: “accelerating while looking for new exits” as Fang put it. Midea Group’s past success represented China’s competitive advantage in terms of low manufacturing costs. However China was at a turning point; its labour cost was rising quickly. Midea Group had to find a new core competency to replace low-cost production while at the same time maintaining fast growth. Fang had a term for the new strategy: “second track.” From 2013 to 2015 Midea Group chose to pursue a mobile strategy developing smart home appliances that could be controlled by mobile apps. Encouraging new businesses might represent the way forward for Midea Group but it could also complicate the firm’s motivation system. Fang needed to bear that consideration in mind when designing the new stock ownership plans. It seemed that too many things needed to be balanced to achieve sustainable success.Exhibit 1: Fang Hongbo’s CareerSource: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Midea EA—Key Financials 2005 to SECOND QUARTER of 2013 (in ¥)Note: ¥ = CNY = Chinese yuan; US$1=CN¥6.8 on January 1 2010; YoY = year over year.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 3: Midea Group—Key Financials 2005 to SECOND QUARTER of 2015 (in ¥)Source: Company materials.Exhibit 4: PROFILEs of KEY MIDEA EXECUTIVES Note: All of the above individuals were Chinese nationals with master’s-level educations.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 5: ExecutiveS’ ShareholdingS and Value When Midea Group ListedNote: Shareholding value based on issuing price of ¥44.56 per share.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 6: Midea HoldingMidea Investments Holding was founded on August 5 2002 with registered capital of CN¥330 million and only two natural-person shareholders: He Xiangjian holding 94.55% and He Xiangjian’s daughter-in-law Lu Deyan holding the remainder.

Padmakar was the general manager of human resources (HR) at BPCL—a global Fortune 500 company engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The awards function was the culmination of an internal competition called IDEAS—a competition that sought innovative ideas from employees. In his welcome address Padmakar stated that the purpose of the IDEAS competition was to “nurture promote and recognize ideas” within the company. He observed that over the years the number of participants had increased (see Exhibit 1) that cost-savings estimated by participants were significant (see Exhibit 2) and that BPCL had benefitted from an influx of new thinking and cross-functional collaboration. Although Padmakar acknowledged the successes he was aware of the challenges facing the competition. Participation seemed to be stagnating quality of ideas was a concern and enthusiasm was waning. Additionally many people thought that winning ideas were not being adequately replicated across the company. This meant that BPCL was not reaping the full benefit that was being demonstrated in the competition. Padmakar wondered what might be done to revitalize IDEAS as a platform for innovation.BACKGROUNDBPCL was founded in 1976 by the Indian government after it acquired Burmah Shell Refineries Ltd. in India. In those years the Indian economy was heavily regulated with several restrictions on private enterprise. The Indian petroleum industry in particular was dominated by three state-owned companies including BPCL. Then in the early 1990s the Indian government began to liberalize its economy. To ensure that the company sustained its competitive advantage BPCL’s then chairman Uppiliappan Sundararajan initiated an organizational restructuring exercise. In order to encourage employee involvement in the restructuring he introduced a process called visionary leadership and planning (VLP). The VLP process involved workshops wherein employees across levels participated in creating the vision statement and business plans for BPCL. “The beauty of this process” explained Sundararajan “was that each one felt as if it were his or her own vision statement.” There was palpable excitement in the organization as employees across levels debated brainstormed and found ways to make things happen. For example in 1998 the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh experienced a severe shortage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Workers and management from a plant at Cherlapalli took the initiative to solve the problem. They located a piece of machinery that lay idle at another plant in Tuticorin in the state of Tamil Nadu. They moved the machinery repaired it and started working an additional shift to increase production and supplies of LPG. The following year BPCL achieved 27 per cent sales growth in the area and the Cherlapalli plant became the company’s lowest-cost LPG bottling plant.This new momentum clearly transformed BPCL into a powerhouse of ideas. But then the leadership team faced a dilemma: how could the company store disseminate and replicate these ideas across the organization? BPCL’s information technology (IT) department provided a solution wherein a database was created and employees were encouraged to post and access information. In addition an electronic newsletter was published to acknowledge and recognize innovative employee ideas. However these attempts seemed inadequate to recognize and reward employees for their contributions. Separately the HR team had initiated a suggestion-box scheme. Employees were encouraged to anonymously suggest improvements for the organization. However this scheme did not ensure the implementation of ideas and rewards for suggestions were not seen to be motivating enough. Thus the VLP process the knowledge management technology and the suggestion scheme generated a flood of ideas. The company then needed to channel those ideas while overcoming limitations of earlier efforts. BPCL’s leaders decided to initiate the IDEAS platform as an internal competition with wide-ranging expectations. Sundararajan wanted IDEAS to foster intrinsic motivation provide the freedom to think enable cross-functional interaction generate and implement ideas and ensure adequate rewards for employees. Sumita Bose expected that IDEAS would increase dynamism in the organization and in turn help improve efficiencies and profits. She said “We felt that we need to do something that would shake the company . . . to make an impact . . . [to] add to the bottom line of the company . . . so we thought of IDEAS.”According to George Paul IDEAS helped align BPCL’s brand promise business strategy and organizational culture. BPCL’s brand promise was about “innovation reliability and caring.” Paul believed that IDEAS had the potential to generate “innovative products services business processes and business models” and help BPCL achieve its strategy of differentiation. This view could be supported by an organizational culture where employees not only believed in the brand promise but also practiced it. Paul said “How do you make the beliefs into a habit and the habit into a culture [?] . . . so that [was] the genesis of creating a platform like IDEAS.”For this reason in 2000 BPCL introduced IDEAS with the objective of nurturing promoting and recognizing ideas within the company.THE IDEAS COMPETITION AND PROCESSBeing the brainchild of the company’s chairman IDEAS found easy acceptability within the organization. The HR team was given the responsibility of designing and implementing the IDEAS competition. Emails were crafted and sent to employees details were uploaded on the company’s intranet and posters were displayed in company offices and plants. All these methods of communication were intended to institutionalize IDEAS as a contest and convey its purpose criteria and award information to employees (see Exhibit 3).One of the guiding principles of the competition was that ideas had no meaning unless they were implemented. Therefore the following criteria were laid down for participation:Ideas should have been implemented during the previous financial year.Ideas should be about the development of new or better products processes or services. They could also be about doing things in a more environmentally friendly manner.Ideas should demonstrate financial benefits improvement in processes and reduction in cycle time or waste.In order to maintain consistency across the organization the HR department outlined a process through which entries were received evaluated and rewarded. The process involved the following three stages:Stage 1: Participant submissions had to highlight the significance of the idea the details of the process employed and the financial benefits accrued. The entry could be submitted in English or any of the following Indian languages: Hindi Marathi Gujarati Tamil Malayalam Kannada Bengali Telugu or Oriya. The purpose of allowing entries in regional languages was to encourage employees in BPCL’s non-management cadre who were not so well-versed in English to participate in the competition.Stage 2: Submissions were screened by an internal jury of senior leaders (general managers and executive directors). Evaluations were based on parameters such as degree of creativity feasibility of implementation benefits accrued (financial and non-financial) potential for replicability and overall impact. This screening served as a filter by which ideas would be shortlisted for the final presentation and evaluation.Stage 3: The final round was held in Mumbai and attended by shortlisted employees from all over the country. Participants had to present their ideas before a panel of jury members comprising subject-matter experts academicians and senior leaders. The final round would culminate in the awards celebration which had the glitz and glamour of a mega-event that employees aspired to be part of.Typically 10 awards would be presented at the annual IDEAS awards celebration. The best idea of the year submitted by a team or individual would receive the chairman’s trophy. In addition some deserving ideas would receive a token of appreciation. Also a special booklet would be printed that would showcase all the award-winning ideas and would be circulated across the company. Early Outcomes and Improvements Several entries from the first version of the IDEAS competition received external recognition. Participants won awards for “excellence in creativity and innovation” at India’s national petroleum management program. Internally BPCL’s HR department studied the outcomes of IDEAS 2000. That department found that an overwhelming number of entries—especially award-winning entries—were about technical innovations. For example 11 of 12 awards were flagged as technical entries. The jury seemed to favour submissions that demonstrated tangible benefits. In order to increase participation from support functions and to ensure a greater focus on measurable outcomes the following categories were introduced for IDEAS 2001: technical process and system improvement marketing and sales initiatives and HR.IDEAS 2000 demonstrated that substantial financial savings might be achieved by the organization. Consequently cash awards were introduced to increase employee participation and derive more value from the competition. In 2001 the chairman’s award carried a prize of US$1100 plus a trophy. The first second and third prize winners were awarded about $400 $300 and $200 respectively. Over time BPCL increased the prize monies to reflect the importance accorded to the competition. However the increases were nominal and when the prize was shared between members of a winning team the monies per individual were not substantial.With an 86 per cent increase in the number of entries (from 88 in 2000 to 164 in 2001) the HR department found it difficult to administer the competition in a centralized manner. Further they expected that the number of submissions would continue to rise; consequently shortlisting entries at an early stage seemed like a good idea. To address this need regional rounds were introduced in 2002 making the competition more of a tournament. Entries within each of BPCL’s four regions would be evaluated within the region itself. Each regional adjudication panel consisted of one internal and one external subject-matter expert. These regional rounds resulted in about 30 per cent of local submissions being shortlisted for the final round and enhanced the visibility of IDEAS at local levels. However decentralizing the process increased logistical requirements and raised questions about whether regional panels were applying evaluation criteria uniformly. Consequently BPCL eventually gave up the idea of a multi-stage tournament and reverted to the traditional format of a centralized competition.Due to sustained review and experimentation IDEAS continued to evolve and develop. In 2003 an online portal was introduced to manage greater numbers of entries and serve as an online repository of knowledge. Employees could use the portal to register new ideas view and comment on other entries and access information to replicate past ideas. Thus the IDEAS portal served as a medium for spreading ideas and building a culture of innovation.New Version of IDEASIn many ways IDEAS appeared to be a huge success; however a degree of sluggishness seemed to have set in. Informal conversations and data from past competitions indicated three trends. First some old ideas were being re-submitted by the same or other participants with minor changes in title or technical specifications. Second support functions such as legal finance HR and marketing had increasing difficulty coming up with radically new ideas year after year. Third most submissions were being received just a few days before the deadline indicating perhaps that innovation was topical and had not been sufficiently embedded in the organizational culture.Therefore the HR team wondered if the competition continued to serve its original purpose of nurturing promoting and recognizing new ideas. In particular was the goal of nurturing new ideas being compromised by the criterion that ideas had to be implemented before they could be submitted? As Jayesh Shah remarked “The condition was [that] unless you implement an idea you can’t participate even if you have a great idea . . . then we thought of introducing three new categories.”In 2008 BPCL’s HR team introduced a new version of IDEAS wherein entries could be submitted in three categories:Creative Stroke: This category was for ideas that had been implemented during the year. Entries in this category should have resulted in cost reduction or process improvement.Mind’s Eye: This category was for ideas that had not been implemented but had high potential for adding value to the organization.Echo: This category was created for successful ideas (from past competitions) that were replicated in a location other than that of their origin. Echo was meant to encourage the diffusion of innovative thinking that had already gone through the cycle of trial and experimentation. The objective of introducing these categories was to make the IDEAS platform more vibrant while maximizing participation. The new categories seemed to yield dramatic results for BPCL. Employees began to collaborate across departmental boundaries in their efforts at innovation. For example the following noteworthy entry surfaced in the Creative Stroke category. It had so happened that the Indian army had constructed a strategic advance landing ground (ALG) for helicopter operations in the Khirmu hills of Arunachal Pradesh. This ALG required a safe and reliable refueling system. Given extreme weather and a difficult terrain this was a daunting task. However BPCL’s employees from the engineering and aviation teams worked together to design and construct a pioneering solution.Another example was an entry in the Mind’s Eye category from the Piyala LPG plant located in Uttar Pradesh. The plant had a manual system of painting LPG cylinders. Typically two workers applied primer and paint to the cylinders through a pneumatic hand-operated spray gun. The working conditions were not particularly favourable. Because the workers had to operate in enclosed spaces for an extended period of time they ran the risk of inhaling toxic fumes leading to respiratory illnesses. The idea to solve this problem was to mount paint spray guns on the existing machinery and make minor technical adjustments that created a semi-automatic system at a reasonable cost.Examples such as these indicated that participation in IDEAS resulted in employees feeling increasingly motivated and engaged in the company. One participant remarked: “I started contributing [to IDEAS] from 2008 onwards. . . . What attracts me more than awards is . . . it’s a place where we can showcase our talent and get an opportunity to rub shoulders with top management.”IDEAS SINCE 2010In 2010 IDEAS completed 10 years of its existence. By then its value as an employee-engagement tool was fairly well established in the minds of the company’s leaders and employees. Dipti Sanzgiri BPCL’s then executive director of HR remarked “IDEAS is a unique initiative saluting the innovative spirit of our people of our organization. I’m sure that each year together we will take it to new heights.” However in 2010 participation in IDEAS dropped by about 40 per cent. By this time the members of the HR team that coordinated IDEAS had changed and Sanzgiri and her team considered a range of new questions. Were employees viewing IDEAS as being owned managed and executed by the HR department alone? Were line managers taking enough responsibility to create an environment to nurture and implement ideas? Was participation in IDEAS being seen as just another item on the to-do list? Was the competition genuinely inspiring employees at the grassroots level where innovation really mattered?Exploring the questions above led Sanzgiri and her team to conceptualize and implement what was called the IDEAS station. This station was a physical space accessible to employees in each of BPCL’s locations. The station would have colour-coded sheets on which employees could write their ideas. Colleagues could build and support the ideas. One manager at each location was appointed as a liaison and was asked to facilitate the process at that location. The model of a traffic light was used to track ideas from generation to implementation. Upon successful implementation an idea would be featured on the green sheet. Those that needed further work would appear on the amber sheet and any ideas that did not seem promising would be moved to the red sheet. The IDEAS station was expected to result in three main benefits. First being a physical space in local offices it was more likely that employees would associate IDEAS with being a local everyday feature of working at BPCL. Second the station might make IDEAS an ongoing process rather than a once-a-year event. Third because the station was accessible to all it was hoped that employees would build on each other’s ideas; this in turn would enhance cross-functional collaboration.Though the IDEAS station was launched with much fanfare and promise the expected momentum did not happen. People were hesitant to post ideas publicly and employees seemed concerned about losing credit for an idea that they thought was original to them. Some were reluctant to join teams involving others’ ideas. It was unclear who would be responsible for implementation. Others lost interest as they felt that the manager responsible had pre-judged the ideas as not having sufficient financial benefit. Sanzgiri was disappointed that the IDEAS station had not been successful. She remarked “I should have realized that it involved a big change management process.” Shah added “Things like this should be driven by top management. Secondly communication did not happen adequately; people could not appreciate the value of the whole process or maybe enough effort was not made to make them understand.”Over the years BPCL continued its efforts to improve IDEAS and celebrate its successes. In 2011 the award-winning ideas of former seasons were chronicled in a coffee-table book. The following year IDEAS was expanded to include joint venture partners and a subsidiary company of BPCL. Branding was also recognized as an important pillar of communication and a logo was created for IDEAS. In 2013 a mascot named “Idee” was introduced to give a face and personality to the competition.Yet IDEAS participants judges and BPCL’s leadership raised some concerns. First judges had observed that a few entries of former years were being repeated—either by the same teams after having made minor improvements or by other teams who did not know of earlier submissions. Second judges were somewhat skeptical about the savings claimed by participants. BPCL’s leaders felt that despite the Echo category award-winning ideas were not being adequately diffused in the organization; as a result the full potential of innovation was not being realized. Finally there were questions about the scope of ideas submitted. Were those innovations that were carried out as part of an employee’s routine responsibilities—for which that employee was paid a salary and had a periodical performance appraisal—to be considered valid entries for IDEAS? Should those submissions that were beyond the scope of the employee’s duties not be accorded additional importance?Amid the concerns and efforts to improve the competition IDEAS also yielded unexpected positive outcomes. For example IDEAS participants scored about 5 per cent higher than non-participants during BPCL’s 360-degree feedback (talent management) process in 2012 and 2014. Thus not only had IDEAS survived for 15 years it seemed to impact matters beyond employee engagement and innovation.WHAT NEXT? In July 2014 Padmakar was appointed as head of the HR department at BPCL. The awards night on January 9 2015 was an opportunity for him to reflect on the future of IDEAS in the context of the broader issues facing the petroleum industry. Three dramatic changes had been occurring in the global petroleum industry. First the international price of crude oil had declined 50 per cent since October 2014. By January 2015 crude was available at about $50 per barrel. Second the Indian government had stopped controlling the price of retail fuels. Third the above two situations had resulted in the Indian fuels market becoming attractive to competition. Now state-owned petroleum companies such as BPCL faced the prospect of losing market share to private companies such as Reliance Petroleum Essar Oil and Shell. In this context the need for innovation at BPCL was stronger than ever before. Yet in 2014 IDEAS participation fell by about 20 per cent. That year some roles and members of the HR team also changed. As he took stock of the situation Padmakar was aware that IDEAS was much appreciated in the organization. Winners in particular had been inspired and spoke highly of the impact of the competition. The leader of the team that received the IDEAS Echo award for 2013 had remarked “Those who have gone and experienced IDEAS are now self-propelled and this in turn has a rub-off effect on others. Now people don’t accept the status quo and [instead] try new ways.” One employee who had twice won the chairman’s award was of the view “In research and development each one of us is busy doing our own jobs. Some of our great works go unnoticed. But [due to] this platform one gets recognition and our hard work gets noticed by everyone. It motivates us to think differently and encourages us to put in extra efforts at work.”However BPCL’s leaders looked beyond apparent successes and asked deeper questions. Sanzgiri said “It is a strong engine for reward and recognition but a weaker engine for innovation . . . . it can become stronger if some other alchemy happens in the organization.” Padmakar wondered what that alchemy might be. He wanted hard data to determine the changes that could be made. Earlier he had asked his team to analyze IDEAS’ historical data from a range of perspectives. They had sent him a summary of their findings (see Exhibits 4 to 8). Among other things Padmakar was heartened to observe that by 2014 participation in IDEAS was inversely correlated with employee attrition (see Exhibit 4). Padmakar saw two distinct possibilities to take IDEAS to the next level—focus on the competitive spirit of IDEAS such that employees wanted to participate win and gain recognition or focus on reinforcing a culture of creativity such that employees collaborated shared knowledge and innovated without the expectation of awards.

For the previous 12 years Midea Refrigerator had been pursuing globalization via direct export but the high cost of exporting products was depleting its profits and undermining its competitiveness in the international market. Therefore a transition from direct exporting to foreign direct investment (FDI) was necessary. However the exact approach to securing FDI was unclear. Securing investments and a domestic environment in either India or Russia would help the company but which one was right for an initial trial? Further once Midea Refrigerator decided on the target nation it would also have to choose the most suitable FDI model: greenfield investment acquisition or joint venture.CHINA’S “GO GLOBAL” STRATEGY AND HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE INDUSTRYBefore the 1980s there were hardly any competitive domestic manufacturers of household appliances in China. The situation changed with China’s economic reform and opening in 1978 as well as the implementation of two strategies: “bring in” and “go global” which referred to the goals of first bringing in foreign companies and technology to develop China and then encouraging Chinese companies to develop their overseas markets. Accordingly China’s household appliance manufacturers started importing equipment and production lines from developed countries learning these new technologies and producing new appliances of their own. In addition foreign manufacturers set up branches in China. By the end of 1994 more than 20 Sino-foreign joint ventures had been established to make household appliances. A number of brands sprang up and waged a nationwide battle of acquisition producing some giants in the field including Midea TCL Gree and Haier. These companies competed against each other and the foreign companies for market share in China. To increase profits they also manufactured electrical components or products for foreign brands acting as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For many household appliance manufacturers in China being an OEM was the first step on the path to go global.In the 21st century even more Chinese enterprises were exporting or operating abroad but foreign household appliance enterprises were pursuing their own strategic shifts after China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. Hitachi Toshiba and Matsushita simultaneously set up innovation centres in China. Samsung LG and A.O. Smith greatly increased their numbers of production lines and investments in the Chinese market. To carve out more market share these brands lowered their prices and forced domestic enterprises into a price battle in which the fledgling Chinese companies paid a heavy price. Suffering from decreasing profits in the Chinese market Chinese household electrical appliance manufacturers had to accelerate their overseas market development. In 2013 Chinese companies looking to go global had a historic opportunity. The “One Belt One Road Initiative” proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping provided a new insight into global expansion. “One Belt” and “One Road” referred to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road Economic Zone which connected Asia with Europe via Russia and Southeast Asia respectively. The initiative was proposed to strengthen ties between China and the countries along the “Belt” and “Road.” With national preferential policies reducing transnational operation risks a number of enterprises had already elected to invest in the “Belt nations” and some household appliance manufacturers were preparing their next move with regard to this changing landscape.MIDEA GROUP AND MIDEA REFRIGERATORMidea GroupEstablished in 1968 Midea Group was a publicly listed Fortune 500 company that offered one of the most comprehensive product ranges in the home appliance industry. It produced diverse equipment for lighting floor care and refrigeration as well as laundry machines large cooking appliances small kitchen appliances and water appliances. In 2015 Midea had 260 logistics centres in more than 200 countries and global revenue of US$22.17 billion.Midea RefrigeratorMidea Refrigerator was established in 2001. In 2004 Midea Group acquired Royalstar Company by acquiring 50.5 per cent of its shares as well as Hefei Hualing Co. Ltd a foreign-invested company whose main business was exporting refrigerators. These acquisitions greatly improved the company’s capability for refrigerator manufacturing. By 2017 Midea Refrigerator had three manufacturing bases in Hefei and Guangzhou with more than 6000 employees. Midea Refrigerator produced products under the brand names Midea Royalstar and Hualing. Both Midea and Royalstar were very well-known brands in China—especially Midea whose value exceeded $4.6 billion in 2016. Gradually Midea Refrigerator became one of the largest refrigerator suppliers in China. Further the firm was continually increasing its development earning $5.4 billion in 2015 in the global market.THE PRODUCT “GOES GLOBAL”Unable to compete directly with the largest corporations in the global market (e.g. Siemens LG Electrolux and Panasonic) Midea Refrigerator like many refrigerator manufacturers in the early 21st century opted to pursue the OEM path. With the advantage of low labour and material costs in China Midea Refrigerator could make a profit by manufacturing refrigerators for international brands like Electrolux Sears LEC and Morita; this arrangement resulted in the shipment of Midea products to dozens of countries and regions and the OEM market came to account for half of Midea Refrigerator’s business.However the landscape changed after 2001. China’s development was reducing OEM profit due to the rising cost of production even as competition in the national market was becoming increasingly fierce. The expansion of Midea Refrigerator also called for more capital. The tide of globalization after China’s WTO entry and the requirement to develop drove Midea Refrigerator to choose one of two options: struggle against adversity and attempt to flourish or watch its profits dwindle away. It was high time to make a transformation. Therefore despite all the uncertainties the company’s manager made the bold choice to launch Midea-brand refrigerators in the global market. But the question remained: how should the company implement this launch? THE BRAND “GOES GLOBAL”The Choice of Channel In 2004 there were hardly any household appliance enterprises in China pursuing global expansion. The only significant player in this category was Haier which adopted a “difficulty first” strategy—occupying the market that was hard to enter first before dealing with the easier ones. Established in 1984 Haier imported China’s first foreign refrigerator manufacturing production line from the German firm Liebherr and proposed a brand-building strategy early in 1985. It exported the first shipment of refrigerators to Germany in 1990 making Europe its first step to entering the global market. In 1995 Haier began to establish overseas factories and in 1996 it opened its first international factory Haier Sapporo in Indonesia. In 1997 Haier set up LKG Electrical Co. Ltd in the Philippines and Haier Industrial Co. Ltd in Malaysia. In 1999 the company established its first industrial park in the United States (in South Carolina). In this way Haier had pursued a direct localization path from the outset.Because it was successful for another large Chinese appliance company Haier’s FDI strategy seemed to be feasible for Midea Refrigerator but Midea Refrigerator declined to follow Haier’s example and turned to a safer path instead: direct export first. He Xiangjian the chairman of Midea Group said “For us low velocity was much better than going astray.” Thus 2005 witnessed the beginning of Midea Refrigerator’s direct export for overseas brand building. The daunting task that remained for the company was to find the right channel and market.Overseas Subsidiary and the Commercial Agent ChannelEarly in 2000 Midea Group’s U.S. subsidiary European subsidiary and Japanese subsidiary started operations and its branches in South Korea and Singapore were established in 2001 which laid a solid foundation for Midea Refrigerator’s export business. The subsidiaries were empowered by the headquarters to draw up their own marketing plans to suit the real conditions of the local market. In this respect Midea Refrigerator benefited from the subsidiaries that the headquarters had opened taking advantage of local expertise. In the process the company honed its skills to set the right prices and conduct the appropriate marketing activities to promote overseas sales. To broaden its existing channels Midea Refrigerator had to make a new path for itself. To export to more overseas markets the company had to cooperate with commercial agents in the target markets. Opening the commercial agent channel was not easy because Midea Refrigerator had to decide which country to start with and then find the appropriate agent. The company was primarily operating as an OEM and the United States was the largest market of Midea-manufactured refrigerators but did that make the country a promising prospect for Midea Refrigerator’s exports? A glance at the U.S. market at the time (i.e. 2004) revealed that its refrigerator market was almost totally carved up among several American giants including Whirlpool and General Electric and some time-honoured foreign brands such as LG and Electrolux. These prominent brands not only had high-quality products but also had the greatest brand awareness among North American consumers which was truly indomitable; the same was true in Europe and many other developed nations which left newcomers only a marginal possibility of success. New geographical locations had to be considered. The manager of Midea Refrigerator carefully considered this vital first step and before long he recognized one area that presented great potential: Australia.Australia: A New Prospect? Early in 1978 the Australian government had included China in a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). GSP was a preferential tariff system that provided for a formal system of exemption from the more general rules of the WTO. A low tariff of 5 per cent greatly benefited Chinese firms that exported to Australia. Moreover Australia was different from many developed nations because of its rarity of resources and the fact that most of its industrial products including household electrical appliances were imported. Most importantly there were not many local refrigerator manufacturers there so Midea Refrigerator’s management reasoned that it might be easier to carve out a market in this less competitive environment. The market prospect was also quite positive because Australia as a developed nation had positive economic performance and rising purchasing power in terms of household appliance consumption. In spite of this generally positive environment the path to Australia was not smooth. The first difficulty was to find the right agent. This agent needed to be powerful and have multiple distribution channels. It took months for Midea Refrigerator’s manager and his team to search and assess candidates before they finally made the decision to cooperate with “X Agency.” Even more difficult was the choice of retailer and this negotiation consumed even more time. It was hard to persuade retailers to change the current product structure. To establish the partnership Midea Refrigerator’s manager had to make significant compromises including full support in terms of resources personnel and technical training as well as offering an agency commission that was 10 per cent higher than the market price and granting exclusive agent rights for the contract year. Ultimately however the deal was settled. Yet finding a place in the Australian market was still far from easy. Foreign giants that had entered the Australian market early (e.g. Electrolux and LG) were strong. Electrolux and LG had 30 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of the Australian refrigerator market so Midea Refrigerator would have to work hard for its own share. To gain this crucial hold the manager and his team used three strategies:First target the “middle-” and “low-end” markets. The high-end market had already been captured by much larger companies. To find out what consumers in the low-end market really needed Midea Refrigerator’s manager and his team conducted market research across the whole Australian refrigerator market. They found that consumers in low-end market attached great importance to the price and energy-conserving qualities of household appliances. In response Midea Refrigerator managed to raise its devices’ energy-conserving abilities and obtained a government certificate for highly energy-efficient products. The company also repeatedly emphasized energy conservation in its marketing while still maintaining a low price point to attract the low-end market. Second make the services localized. In providing services Midea Refrigerator insisted on employing local people to serve the local market especially in positions that involved direct contact with consumers. Third quickly raise brand recognition. Midea Refrigerator held roadshows undertook promotional activities and sponsored popular local events. Most Australian consumers were sports fans and many important sports events were held in Australia making these events ideal national advertising platforms. Midea Group seized the opportunity to become the premier partner sponsor of Melbourne City Football Club so that the brand of Midea Refrigerator could also be widely circulated. The battle for market share in Australia was challenging but opening its first overseas market was highly beneficial for Midea Refrigerator and taught the company many lessons to be used in future expansions as well. By 2015 Midea Refrigerator had entered the U.S. Canadian Malaysian Indonesian Chilean and Vietnamese markets through the company’s subsidiaries and established partnerships with many commercial agents including UE Tech Co. Ltd. in South Korea VSK International Co. Ltd. in Myanmar and Tovarischestvo in Kazakhstan. The growth rate of its direct exports in the global market was buoyant.GLOBAL STRATEGYCompetition in the global market remained fierce. To increase its profits Midea Refrigerator had to lower its costs and make greater breakthroughs in terms of technology. The company was constantly increasing its efforts to achieve these goals.Efficiency ImprovementMidea Refrigerator adopted the “T+3” model to improve efficiency and lower costs. This customer-order model was first developed by the Midea Washing Machine department and was then adopted by the whole company to shorten each cycle (i.e. order receiving material preparation manufacturing and delivery) to less than three days. By adopting the T+3 model the company could quickly respond to orders from anywhere in the world and promptly transport the necessary products or product components to the corresponding market. Technology BreakthroughTo enhance its core competitiveness around the globe Midea Refrigerator continued to strengthen its technology by cooperating with global refrigerator giants like Electrolux and Whirlpool; this cooperation included employing refrigerator experts from Japan and South Korean among other initiatives. Midea Refrigerator received many international certifications including safety certification from US Underwriter Laboratories Inc.—the most authoritative organization in the United States engaging in safety appraisement EU Energy Star certification and TUV quality certification—a widely recognized quality certification in Europe granted by TUV Rheiland. The company also invested more in intelligent refrigerator development. Experts predicted that the intelligent refrigerator was the future of the refrigerator industry around the world and that the global market for intelligent refrigerators would increase at a rate of 8 per cent to 10 per cent. Midea Refrigerator invested in this business niche and was soon a world leader in intelligent refrigerator development. The firm collaborated with Chinese online commerce company Alibaba to formally launch its intelligent refrigerator with the Alibaba Cloud system on September 8 2016. This launch made Midea Refrigerator’s “intelligent system” more localized to consumers in different countries.THE COMPANY “GOES GLOBAL”Despite these efforts Midea Refrigerator’s global market continued to depend solely on direct export which restricted further development and its market share was still limited in some countries. The costs of cross-country transportation and tariffs continued to rise which gave the company little leeway to lower its prices in order to compete with other multinational firms. Twelve years after the decision to launch the brand using direct export Midea Refrigerator opted to take the next strategic step: FDI.Which country should serve as the company’s starting point for FDI? The manager of Midea Refrigerator felt that there were only two clear options: Russia or India. Both countries fit the “One Belt One Road Initiative” which meant that the investment could enjoy favourable national conditions. On the one hand Russia was a large market: 80 per cent of its household electrical appliances were imported from abroad and its consumption rate was increasing by nearly 15 per cent annually. Moreover the country’s refrigerator market comprised 30 per cent of the overall household appliances market. On the other hand India was an emerging economy in Southeast Asia with rising national gross domestic product (GDP) and purchasing power. India’s refrigerator market had significant potential because its climate required the use of refrigeration to keep food fresh. In addition the Indian government had been encouraging FDI in its manufacturing area.Yet another question presented itself to Midea Refrigerator’s manager: which FDI model—greenfield investment acquisition or joint venture—was most suitable for each of the prospective countries? These decisions were key to Midea Refrigerator’s future.

CP had built the country’s first transcontinental railroad in the 19th century. Its board of directors was the target of a proxy battle for control of the firm initiated by Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. (Pershing Square) in March 2012. Both CP and Pershing Square had made presentations to proxy advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Proxy advisors provided voting recommendations to clients such as private funds and institutional investors. As part of their analysis the proxy advisors received information from management and from the dissident shareholder Pershing Square. Due to the lack of voting direction by management and CP’s high level of institutional ownership Smith believed that the recommendations of proxy advisors would be key in the proxy contest but she also needed to perform her own analysis of the intrinsic value of CP shares under the scenario of the status quo with CP’s current management and strategy in place versus a potential shakeup as suggested by Pershing Square.One statement in Pershing Square’s dissident presentation which had been sent out on January 24 2012 stood out for Smith: “Canadian Pacific is 70 per cent the size of Canadian National yet has an enterprise value 40 per cent as large due to its inferior profitability and asset utilization.”Class I North American RailroadsRailroad companies were ranked by revenues with Class I railroads being the biggest and Class III railroads the smallest. In the United States a Class I railroad had at least US$250 million in sales; in Canada a Class I railroad had at least CA$250 million in sales. The United States and Canada had six Class I railroads: Union Pacific CSX Norfolk Southern Canadian National Railway (CN) CP and Kansas City Southern (plus BNSF a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway). Rail was an integral part of the transportation network in North America for goods grains and commodities. For example more than two-thirds of U.S. coal was carried by rail. Rail was typically used as part of intermodal operations facilitated by the use of standardized containers that could be moved from trucks to rail to ships. The single most important measure of profitability in the railroad industry was the operating ratio defined as the firm’s operating expenses as a percentage of its total revenues. A lower operating ratio was desirable and firms targeted operating ratios below 80 with a figure in the mid-70s being more desirable. Components of these operating expenses included major categories such as labour materials fuel and depreciation. Of operating expenses labour could account for more than a third and fuel could account for a fifth.Operating ratios at these six major railroads had improved as non-core infrastructure was divested investments were made in more efficient equipment and new operating procedures were adopted. For example CN’s operating ratio declined to 63.6 per cent in 2010 from 97.1 per cent in 1992. Over the same period CP’s operating ratio dropped to 77.6 per cent from 95.9 per cent (see Exhibit 1). Canadian Pacific RailwayThe Canadian Pacific Railway was incorporated on February 16 1881 with the intent of building a transcontinental railway in Canada. As a condition of joining Canada’s confederation in 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were promised rail links with Quebec and Ontario. But government mismanagement resulted in little progress on the project until a group of businessmen founded CP. A century later in 1986 CP was the nation’s second-largest firm with $15 billion in revenues and had become a conglomerate with subsidiaries in energy commodities hotels and ships. With the goal of unlocking shareholder value Canadian Pacific’s parent company spun out its five subsidiaries—CP Pan Canadian Energy Fording Coal CP (later Fairmont) Hotels and CP Ships—into separate companies on October 3 2001. CP had a 14700-mile (23657-kilometre) network of railroads and intermodal transportation links from the Port of Vancouver in Canada’s West to the Port of Montreal in Canada’s East and to the U.S. industrial centres of Chicago Newark Philadelphia Washington New York City and Buffalo. This network transported bulk commodities merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. In 2011 CP’s strategic goal was to “become the safest most fluid railway in North America” focusing on five areas: service safety productivity and efficiency people and growth.CP’s board included members of the country’s business elite. For example John Cleghorn was the former chairman and chief executive of the Royal Bank of Canada the country’s largest financial services company. Frederic J. Green had been the firm’s chief executive officer (CEO) since 2006 (see Exhibit 2).CP faced a challenging first six months in 2011 as a result of disruptions to its operations due to severe winter weather and flooding. These delays limited the speed at which its trains could travel and productivity had suffered. The firm worked in the second half of 2011 to restore service and its reputation for customer focus. Management stated:Despite these challenges we were able to complete our planned capital program in 2011. Our continued work on building new sidings and extending our current ones to support our long-train strategy paid dividends; CP set a new full-year record in train weights in 2011. In addition we set full year records in both terminal dwell and car miles per car day as a result of implementing our First Mile-Last Mile program in Canada. We expect further improvements as we continue to tighten standards in Canada and roll out the program in the U.S. We completed the second phase of our Locomotive Reliability Centre strategy which will reduce the number of major locomotive repair facilities from eight to four highly efficient super shops with improved repair capabilities. These improved efficiencies will allow us to do more with less and to reduce our asset pools and associated costs.CP has signed several commercial agreements with customers terminal operators and ports that will drive improvements in supply chain performance. In early 2012 we announced a new five-year agreement with Canadian Tire and a ten-year agreement with Canpotex. In addition CP has worked with its customers leveraging technology to enhance car request management and implementing new productivity tools. Our scheduled grain program has been successfully implemented in Canada and the U.S. program will be implemented by August 2012. We are also developing new volumes of Powder River Basin coal for export off the west coast of British Columbia.In 2011 CP’s accomplishments includedManaging overall indebtedness by repaying US$246 million of maturing 2011 debt and by calling US$101 million of 2013 debt; Making a $600 million voluntary prepayment to its main Canadian defined benefit pension plan; andDelivering consistent dividend growth by increasing its quarterly dividend to common shareholders by 11 per cent from $0.27 to $0.30 in 2011.CP announced a goal of bringing its operating ratio down to the range of 70–72 per cent for 2014 and continued improvement beyond 2014. It aimed to reduce the operating ratio to the range of 68.5–70.5 per cent by 2016. According to CP’s position much of the difference in operating ratios compared with other railroads was due to external factors such as legacy pension costs; tighter curves and steeper grades that required slower speeds and more locomotives respectively; and greater competition along its routes.Between April and September 2011 the trading price of CP’s common shares declined from approximately $63 per share to a low in late September of just below $49 per share. CP’s stock price performance for the 10-year period 2002 to 2012 was roughly similar to a Toronto Stock Exchange index but fared much lower than CN’s performance (see Exhibit 3). Pershing Square Capital ManagementWith a corporate partner Leucadia National William Ackman founded Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing Square) a hedge fund in 2004 with US$54 million of his own capital. Pershing Square was known for taking large positions in targeted firms and being actively engaged in their management. Recent activist campaigns included Target Corp. Canadian Tire Wendy’s (forcing the company to spin-off Tim Hortons) and most recently J.C. Penney. Ackman’s track record included successes and failures. After a months-long debate between Target Corp.’s management and Ackman shareholders voted down Ackman’s effort to gain board representation at their annual meeting in Waukesha Wisconsin. In a preliminary tally of voting more than 70 per cent voted in favour of the company’s proposed slate of directors and the same margin voted to keep the size of the board the same. Target Corp. had urged its shareholders to vote in favour of a proposal to set the size of the board at 12 and to vote for the company’s nominees.In a regulatory filing released October 28 2011 Pershing Square indicated it owned an aggregate 20.7 million common shares (which included 2.65 million common shares underlying a call option) representing 12.2 per cent of CP’s outstanding common shares. The firm had begun buying CP shares in September 2011 investing $1.1 billion in total for an average price of $54.46 per common share. Pershing Square’s intent according to the filing was to discuss with CP’s management its board and other shareholders ways in which the business could be improved.Ackman’s chief recommendation was to install Hunter Harrison as CP’s new CEO. With an established track record as CN’s chief operating officer and then its CEO Harrison had a reputation for improving CN’s productivity and profits. He had reduced staff levels and introduced the concept of precision railroading which involved putting operations on a strict schedule. His drive for efficiencies had even led to the implementation of penalties for customers who did not load or unload their freight on time. The Role of BoardsA board of directors was generally accepted as being necessary to manage the agency relationship created by the separation of ownership and management and was a legal requirement for incorporation. A board was ultimately responsible to the shareholders for all aspects of the corporation but would delegate most of the operating responsibility to professional management. Thus in any firm a board had specific responsibility for hiring performance evaluation compensation and succession of the CEO. A board might also choose to require management to obtain the board’s specific approval before proceeding with certain types of initiatives such as strategic changes major financial commitments and significant acquisitions. In those areas management was responsible for initiating proposals and implementing board-approved decisions; the board of directors was responsible for choice among and/or ratification of management recommendations and monitoring their implementation by management. From a corporate governance perspective boards were being encouraged to re-evaluate the meaning of the phrase in the Canadian Business Corporations Act (see Item 122 (1) (a) page 88) “act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Corporation.” One perspective was that it meant in the best interests of the shareholders commonly known as the shareholder primacy norm. A second perspective was that it meant in the best interest of all stakeholders which was known as the plurality perspective. This view included shareholders debtors communities provincial and federal governments the environment customers suppliers employees managers members of boards and other stakeholders. A third perspective was that the corporation was viewed as a legal entity in and of itself and that the phrase literally meant in the best interests of the corporation as a legal entity. According to this perspective boards could make decisions that would sustain the corporation and be to the detriment of all other stakeholders including shareholders and debtors.The TimelineIn late September 2011 funds controlled by Pershing Square began acquiring common shares of CP at prices of approximately $50 a share approximating the two-year low in CP’s trading price. By October 18 2011 Pershing Square had acquired more than 5 per cent of the outstanding CP shares prompting an obligation to file a Schedule 13D report with the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States where its stock was listed for trading. By the time that report was filed on October 28 2011 Pershing Square’s interest exceeded 10 per cent resulting in an obligation to file an early warning report with securities regulators in Canada where its stocks were also listed for trading which ultimately was filed five days later. Pershing Square disclosed in those reports its belief that CP’s shares were undervalued and that it was engaging in discussions with management the board and other shareholders regarding CP. Subsequent negotiations between CP’s board and Pershing Square broke down and by early January 2012 the two sides were entrenched in their positions and the public was aware that a proxy battle was imminent. CP’s board decided to address its investors and the public by publishing an Open Letter to Pershing Square on January 3 2012. In it CP’s board aimed to correct what it felt were inaccurate comments by Pershing Square and reiterated CP’s invitation for Ackman to join its board subject to a few restrictions. Ackman’s response provided in an Open Letter to CP on January 9 2012 indicated that Pershing Square felt its media statements were accurate. He went on to assert that Pershing Square intended to transform CP’s culture and operations with the goal of turning it into one of the best railroads in North America. Ackman also defended his decision to put forth Harrison as CP’s new leader. Pershing Square’s nominees for the board included three independent Canadian business leaders (see Exhibit 4).Pershing Square sent a requisition for a shareholder meeting to CP on January 23 2012 but when CP later that same day announced that its annual meeting would be held on May 17 2012 Pershing Square withdrew its requisition. Pershing Square filed a dissident information circular on January 24 2012 and began holding public investor meetings to build support. CP filed its proxy circular on March 22 2012 and began holding its own public investor meetings. Various proxy battles followed intended to gather enough shareholder votes to win corporate votes (see Appendix 1).Smith Gathers Information for her ReviewSmith supplemented her analysis with an overview of current economic conditions. She noted that the Government of Canada’s benchmark 10-year bond had a yield of 1.79 per cent at the end of April 2012. In Canada real gross domestic product was expected to achieve annual growth of 2 per cent in 2012 and then increase to an average annual growth rate of 2.2 per cent between 2013 and 2016. Canadian exporters were forecast to be negatively affected by a slowdown in the Euro zone and China and the Canadian dollar was expected to be at or around parity to the U.S. dollar until 2016. In the United States the economy was in the midst of a broad-based recovery with the unemployment rate trending downward. The United States was expected to grow at a slightly faster pace—2.3 per cent per year from 2013 to 2016 (see Exhibit 5) as real private consumption rose and as exports grew especially to emerging markets.What Smith read about Ackman’s public statements seemed to provide reassurance that he did not want to take over the entire board:Pershing Square—What a vote for the Nominees for Management Change (NMC) does NOT mean: Not a change of control; NMC will be five of 13 or 15 directors. Pershing Square would have two of 13 or 15 Board seats (proportionate to ownership). The entire refreshed Board will make the CEO hiring decision.In contrast she sensed frustration on Green’s part when he stated that bringing Harrison’s management methods was counter to the culture he was trying to build at the firm. Green stated:You can work your way across the breadth of stakeholders whether it’s communities governments customers or shareholders people see the risk attached to this proposal. The venom that exists in the shipper community towards the dismissive attitude that Mr. Harrison brought to the marketplace is what it is.CP’s income statements balance sheets and cash flow statements provided Smith with a great amount of financial information (see Exhibits 5 6 and 7 respectively). Smith also read that some believed it would be difficult for Harrison to transfer his methods from CN to CP. First CP’s railroads traversed tougher terrain in contrast to the easier routes taken by CN. Second CP had higher labour costs and was in discussions with its union to improve productivity including implementing a 12-hour workday and new rules on vacations. The Teamsters union represented 4800 CP conductors engineers and rail traffic controllers. To show his interest in the top job Harrison had purchased $5 million worth of CP shares earlier in 2011.Ackman believed that despite the differences between CN and CP the latter could be more profitable arguing that under Harrison’s leadership it could achieve an operating ratio of 65 per cent by 2015. Green countered insisting that an adversarial attitude would be unproductive as 80 per cent of its business was subject to direct competition. The Oliver Wyman Group an independent consultant hired by CP to gauge the feasibility of both plans concluded that Harrison’s target was “not possible” whereas CP’s was both “reasonable and achievable” and also took into consideration the steeper grades and greater curvature of CP’s network which the consultant estimated that it would add about 6.7 per cent to its operating ratio. “Curves and grades [are] physics and the dismissive comments by Harrison indicate a clear lack of research or understanding or both” Green said.Smith Estimates CP’s ValueSmith at GBR Capital wanted to value CP’s shares based on the status quo and current management versus Hunter Harrison as CEO implementing a cost-cutting program (for simplicity as of December 31 2011). In doing this valuation Smith needed to develop two sets of projected cash flows and review information on comparable railroads. She created a set of estimates that included the status quo and a more optimistic forecast that assumed Harrison would become CEO and implement a new strategy. The status quo forecast—from 2012 to 2016—would have revenues at $5.6 billion in 2012 and rising 4 per cent per year. The operating ratio would start at 80 per cent and decrease to 76 per cent by 2016. Depreciation would start at $600 million and capital expenditures at $1.1 billion. Both figures would rise by $25 million each year. The more optimistic forecast included revenue projections that also started at $5.6 billion in 2012 and rose by 5 per cent per year. The operating ratio would start at 76 per cent and decrease to 68 per cent by 2016. Her estimate of depreciation expenses would not change. She estimated capital expenditures in 2012 at $1 billion rising by $25 million a year reflecting the conjecture that Harrison would be focused on cutting costs and investing capital more efficiently. Smith gathered comparative information on competitive firms (see Exhibit 9). She contemplated how best to use this information to estimate intrinsic values under the two scenarios.Smith planned to estimate intrinsic values using a discounted cash flow approach as well as relative valuations. She assumed a tax rate of 25 per cent. She planned to use the capital asset pricing model to estimate the cost of equity using a risk-free rate of 1.79 per cent a beta of 1.3 and an expected market risk premium of 5.0 per cent. CP’s before-tax cost of debt was 6 per cent. Smith ignored any changes in working capital which she assumed would not be material. Under both scenarios Smith assumed a growth of free cash flows beyond the next five years at 2 per cent. She also pondered what kind of return equity investors might garner over a five-year horizon under the two scenarios assuming Pershing Square’s average acquisition price.In the short term Smith faced the proxy vote decision. She needed to send in GBR Capital’s votes on behalf of her fund. While her main aim was to make a decision that would maximize value for GBR Capital’s investors Smith also questioned the extent to which her decision should factor in CP’s corporate governance issues.Exhibit 1: CaNadian pacific AND Canadian national railway financial performance and OPERATING RATIOS 2007–2011 (in CA$ millions)Source: Canadian Pacific 2007 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2007/AR2007.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2008 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2008/AR2008.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2009 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2009/AR2009.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2010 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2010/AR2010.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2011 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2011/AR2011.pdf; Canadian National Railway Company 2007 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2007-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2008 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2008-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2009 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2009-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2010 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2010-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2011 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2011-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den.Exhibit 2: Frederic J.

The proxy battle is the efforts by management and the dissident to gather enough shareholder votes and proxies to win the corporate vote. Usually the proxy battle is a vote to replace members of the board of directors (BOD). The dissidents will attempt to persuade existing shareholders to vote out the company’s board or a portion of the board and possibly change management so that the company can embark on the dissident suggested strategy. This “attack” may result in resistance from the company’s BOD sometimes known as entrenchment. The dissatisfied shareholders try to persuade other shareholders to allow their proxy votes to be used to support proposed changes to the company’s board members. The shareholders trying to change the board members may opt for 100 per cent change or a portion thereof. More recently dissident shareholders have had success changing 50 per cent of the board members to achieve their corporate directional change and have had an easier time convincing proxy advisors to support less than 100 per cent board change allowing for some continuity with the existing board and new board members. Even with a few new board members after a proxy battle returning board members are typically more receptive to shareholders’ proposed changes making it easier to implement them. The company may move in a new direction as decided by the BOD and recommended by the dissidents that started the proxy battle.Management and dissidents use solicitation methods to influence shareholder votes for agenda items proposed at the meeting most importantly BOD members. All shareholders have voting rights based on their share position holding. Registered shareholders are shareholders that hold their shares directly with the company’s transfer agent. The company has access to their name address and share position. Non-registered shareholders hold shares though a broker or custodian and the company does not have direct access to them or their share position. These shareholders would include retail shareholders that purchase shares through their broker and institutional shareholders including pension funds and mutual funds that are managing stock on behalf of groups of individuals but the institutional investor fund manager has the voting authority. In many cases institutional investors defer voting authority for routine meeting agenda items to one of the two proxy advisors in North America Glass Lewis or Institutional Shareholder Services. For a proxy battle the institutional investor will often direct its voting decision but consider the advice of the proxy advisor. Based on share price and buying power institutional shareholders carry much more sway in the voting outcome than retail shareholders.To help facilitate voting management and/or the dissident may hire its own proxy solicitation firm that contacts shareholders soliciting their vote. The proxy solicitor compiles a list of shareholders and their approximate share positions and attempts to contact the shareholders to state the case that they represent. The proxy solicitor (or solicitors) will also arrange a conference call or in-person meeting with the proxy advisors to allow their client management or the dissident to present a report on their position.Ultimately all shareholders submit their votes to the public company’s transfer agent for tabulation. The tabulation results are shared with the company throughout the process and final results are sent to the corporate secretary at the proxy cut-off date as outlined in the proxy circular. Dissidents and their proxy solicitors may scrutinize and challenge the votes after a meeting to confirm that they accept the outcome or to note that they think the outcome was unclear (i.e. if they think shareholders voted multiple times or if the votes seem irregular). Directors are approved based on the votes received.Because most retail shareholders are passive investors gaining retail shareholders’ attention is difficult. Shareholders typically agree to the recommendations mailed to them without examining the proxy circular but they also have little impact on the outcome due to their small shareholding. Appendix 1 (continued)Institutional shareholders consider board and management changes very carefully and will also rely on proxy advisors’ opinions. They are active investors/voters and they can swing outcomes because of their large share positions. Institutional advisors will also consider management recommendations in making their final decisions which depend on resolving two questions: “Who does management want on the board and why? Is there some reasonable solution or outcome with the vote that the institutional investors can support?”Management can rely on a universal proxy to present both its recommendation and the activist’s recommendation on the same form. The universal proxy lists all nominees both management and dissident for the board of directors on one proxy form. Shareholders have the option to choose from the list those whom they want on the board up to the maximum of positions available (i.e. 22 nominees for 17 positions). Management’s recommendation is for its proposed BOD but shareholders have the option to pick and choose which individuals they wanted to comprise the BOD. Without a universal ballot the shareholder can be presented with a stark choice of the following two options: vote on the dissident’s proxy form voting “for” or “withhold” against the dissident nominees; or vote on management's proxy voting “for” or “withhold” against the management nominees.In Canada there is no restriction on a dissident including management’s nominees in its proxy. For example without a universal proxy a dissent such as Pershing Square could suggest the Canadian Pacific BOD individuals it wanted to keep on the new BOD. In the particular situation at hand acting pre-emptively Canadian Pacific adopted a universal proxy that included Pershing Square’s nominees. This move placed the responsibility of deciding on the new board on shareholders. Source: Created by the case authors.",1.0,WHITE,SOUTH AMERICA,WOMAN,

Commonly available bundles include a sofa set and a coffee table; a wedding planning service that includes photography catering and logistics; a washing machine and refrigerator sold as a package by an electronic goods reseller; and a tax consultancy service and an investment advisory service offered together by a consultant. Bundles differ in the way the constituent products or the bundle components are sold together or bundled. Historically firms that have monopoly power over one component have used bundling to extend their monopoly to other competitive markets. Such a bundling strategy is called pure bundling and is largely considered anti-competitive today. Pure BundlingPure bundling is the practice of selling two or more different products only as part of the same package and not separately. In the past many firms have used pure bundling to great effect. For example Microsoft’s strategy of bundling its proprietary Windows operating system with its Internet browser Internet Explorer had a dramatic effect on competition in the Internet browser market. Microsoft never intended to sell Internet Explorer separately but only as part of the Windows operating system and Internet Explorer bundle. However given that pure bundling is considered anti-competitive and hence illegal instances of pure bundles are currently rare. Nevertheless pure bundling by virtue of being the most basic and primitive form of bundling provides a sound foundation for understanding and elucidating the working principles of two advanced forms of bundling: price bundling and product bundling. These advanced bundling strategies are defined and discussed below. Typically bundles are sold at a price discount which serves as an incentive for consumers to buy the bundle versus buying the components separately. In essence the price discount acts as a glue that makes the bundle components stick together as part of the same package. Such a bundling strategy is known as price bundling. Price bundling does not necessitate a firm having monopoly power on any one of the components and is therefore applicable to modern-day competitive markets. Price BundlingPrice bundling is the sale of two or more separate products at a price discount without any integration of the components. In reality most bundles conform to the price bundling strategy wherein consumers reserve the option to buy either the entire bundle or any one of the individual components separately. A classic example of a price bundle is the McDonald’s meal combo consisting of a burger fries and a drink. This combination comes at a price discount over the sum of the individual prices for the burger fries and the drink when bought separately. Other examples may include a bundle comprising a clothes dryer and a washing machine that are sold at a discount by a consumer goods reseller. Price bundling is also known as mixed bundling. In the definition for price bundling lack of integration implies the bundle components lack complementarity or interdependency. In other words any type of product can be bundled and sold as part of the same package as long as a price discount is offered on the bundle purchase over and above the sum of the individual prices of each of the components. Such a strategy will work whether or not the components are integrated so long as the price discount is offered. However a firm can incentivize consumers to buy a bundle (instead of buying the components separately) by integrating the components in a meaningful manner. That is the components are glued together by the integration created by the seller among the components. Such a bundling strategy is called product bundling. Product BundlingProduct bundling is the integration and sale of two or more separate products in the same package at any price. Product bundles may include a sofa set and a matching coffee table wherein the matching feature integrates the two furniture items by virtue of the aesthetic appeal the components jointly present to consumers. Such a strategy may allow a firm to command a higher price for the entire bundle compared with for instance a bundle comprising the same sofa set and a standard coffee table that does not match the design of the sofa set but is of comparable quality. The bundle consisting of the sofa set and the standard coffee table in this case cannot be sold at a premium over the sum of the individual components prices but only at a price discount as an incentive to consumers. In summary while a sofa set and a matching coffee table that is sold at a price premium constitutes a product bundle the same sofa set and a standard coffee table sold at a price discount constitutes a price bundle. Of course the firm may choose to sell the sofa set and the matching coffee table at a lower price; however in that case the firm will leave money on the table by choosing not to appropriate (for whatever reasons) the higher value created by virtue of the matching design that enhances the aesthetic appeal of the bundle. Another example of a product bundle is an all-inclusive wedding planning service. The greater convenience associated with only one firm handling a large emotionally charged and—ideally—once-in-a-lifetime event such as a wedding can increase consumers’ propensity to avail the services of the firm. In this case too the firm stands to earn greater profit from the added value created by the convenience to the consumer and the reduction in the consumer’s psychological cost (i.e. stress) associated with managing such an event. Product bundles differ fundamentally from price bundles not only in terms of the type of incentive used to bundle the individual components (i.e. price incentives for price bundles versus non-price incentives for product bundles) but also in terms of the customer segment each bundling strategy appeals to and its working mechanism. In this context it is worth mentioning that in all definitions of the three forms of bundling thus presented the word separate (and separately) implies the existence of independent competitive markets for each of the bundle components—e.g. a competitive market for operating systems and a competitive market for Internet browsers. In other words while pure bundling necessitates a firm having monopoly power over at least one of the components in the bundle price bundling and product bundling impose no such restrictions. In this note these issues are addressed and elucidated as are the working mechanism of each of the three bundling strategies through a combination of graphical illustrations and spreadsheet simulations wherever necessary. The following section presents the working principles of the three bundling strategies starting with pure bundling followed by the price bundling and the product bundling strategies. The concluding section of this note discusses the strategic marketing implications of bundling. BUNDLING WORKING PRINCIPLESThe Pure Bundling Working PrincipleThe working principle of pure bundling relies on the mechanism of the transfer of consumer surplus (the difference between a consumer’s reservation price or maximum willingness to pay for a product and the price charged by the firm for the product) from the bundle’s higher-valued component to the lesser-valued component(s). Pure bundling as opposed to selling products separately (i.e. unbundling) earns the highest profit when consumers’ reservation prices for the component products are perfectly negatively correlated as illustrated graphically in Exhibit 1A. Exhibit 1A is a scatter plot of reservation prices for two separate products a package of jelly beans and a bar of chocolate for three customers named Rahul Neil and Amber represented by the three dots in the plot. From Exhibit 1A we can see that while Rahul loves chocolate very much he does not like jelly beans as much. The opposite holds true for Amber while Neil values both products equally. Further in this case it is assumed that the consumption of any one of the two products does not affect the enjoyment of the other in any way i.e. the reservation prices of each of the products are independent of each other. In the current context it is assumed that the consumption of jelly beans neither compromises nor enhances the consumption of the chocolate for any one of the consumers and vice versa. In Exhibit 1A the reservations prices for the three consumers are perfectly negatively correlated i.e. the three dots representing the three consumers fall exactly on the same straight line AB. In this example by setting a price of $10 for the entire bundle the firm can appropriate all the consumer surplus from the consumers in the market i.e. the firm can price discriminate perfectly (see Exhibit 1A). The firm maximizes profit without any “wastage” of consumer surplus. In fact by bundling a firm can earn higher profits as compared with selling the jelly beans and the chocolate separately (i.e. unbundling). A numerical proof of these results is presented as spreadsheet simulation exercises in the Excel workbook titled Bundling Exercise A provided along with this note. Further in Exhibit 1B for any combination of individual prices that sum up to the total bundle price of $10 or for any partition of the total bundle price any given consumer say Amber can offset a deficit in consumer surplus on one of the two confectioneries by the consumer surplus enjoyed by her on the other. In other words Amber compensates for her relative dislike of jelly beans by transferring her surplus desirability for chocolate in justifying her decision to consume both confectioneries. Exhibit 1B illustrates this mechanism. The famous scrumptious buffets served at Las Vegas casinos offer a real-life example. These buffets can simultaneously cater to dessert lovers (assuming these consumers despise salads) and health-conscious salad eaters (who consider desserts to contain no nutritional value) as well as those who love to eat both salads and desserts. When consumers’ reservation prices are positively correlated however bundling does not provide any additional advantage over selling the components separately. Please see Exhibit 2 for a graphical illustration and refer to the Excel workbook titled Bundling Exercise A for a numerical proof and illustration. The Price Bundling Working PrincipleFor a price bundling or a mixed bundling strategy the price discount is the only factor motivating bundle purchase as opposed to for instance the added value that consumers may find in the joint consumption or usage of the bundle components (e.g. the all-inclusive wedding service discussed earlier). However the price discount may not be a sufficient inducement for consumers who may find greater value in purchasing only one of the components versus the entire bundle. Intuitively these consumers have a very high valuation for only one of the components in the bundle and a very low valuation for the other. In this case the firm stands to gain by selling the higher valued products separately to these specific consumers. In other words the higher the heterogeneity in reservation prices among the consumers the higher the probability that a mixed bundling strategy as opposed to a pure bundling strategy will earn greater profit. Further mixed bundling may earn more profit compared with pure bundling when consumers’ reservation prices are not perfectly negatively correlated and/or the marginal costs of production of the components are non-zero. These assertions are explained and illustrated graphically in Exhibits 3 and 4. For numerical proofs and illustrations refer to the workbook titled Bundling Exercise A which also includes a provision for comparing the efficacy of the price bundling and the pure bundling strategies on the same set of consumers. Further the second workbook titled Bundling Exercise B provides the opportunity to conduct Monte Carlo simulations based on random draws from a normally distributed population of reservation prices from 10 consumers to determine the optimal bundle and component prices for a mixed bundling strategy. The simulations can be run for different sets of population parameters (e.g. the mean and standard deviation of reservation prices). In Appendix 1 the average profitability from mixed bundling from two such simulation runs are compared for two different dispersion (i.e. standard deviation) parameter values of reservation prices. The Product Bundling Working PrincipleFor product bundles consumers find greater value in the joint consumption of the bundle components versus consuming the components separately; in this situation the assumption of demand independence or independence of reservation prices does not hold. By combining products imaginatively firms can create bundles that are valued more than the sum of their components. The higher reservation price or desirability for the bundle provides firms with the opportunity to earn greater profits than when such joint effects are non-existent (e.g. the sofa set and the standard coffee table). The working mechanism of product bundling is illustrated in Exhibit 5.In Exhibit 5 Panel A two consumers—Rihaan and Roshni represented by stars—remain below a generic bundle price line AB and hence do not buy the particular bundle as the sum of their reservation prices for the bundle components is lower than the total bundle price. However consumers Rahul and Amber represented by dots remain on line AB and hence can buy the bundle; the sum of their reservation prices for the components equal the bundle price. However if all four consumers find greater value in jointly consuming the two bundle components (e.g. the consumers enjoy having milk and cookies together more than having each of the products separately) all four consumers will migrate toward the east or the north or anywhere in between as indicated in Panel B in Exhibit 5 depending on their relative desirability for the components (milk and cookies). The outcome is that at least some of the consumers who were not buying the bundle thus far can buy the product bundle now as illustrated in Panels B and C in Exhibit 5. Given this outcome the firm can subsequently raise the price of the entire bundle to capture the value which is created by shifting the bundle price line AB to the right to AB* as shown in Panel C. A significant implication is that having a consumer surplus on at least one of the bundle components is no longer a necessary condition for bundling to become a viable strategy. Panels B and C also suggest that product bundling can serve as a potent strategy to expand into a new consumer segment (Rihaan and Roshni) that thus far remained untapped. DISCUSSIONIn this note the economic logic of bundling is enunciated using a basic two-product bundle under two fundamentally different assumptions in terms of the interaction between consumers’ reservation prices. Pure bundling and price (mixed) bundling assume an independence of reservation prices or demand. Under this condition bundling can succeed through the mechanism of the transfer of consumer surplus as discussed earlier in the note. The mechanism of the transfer of consumer surplus opens up an interesting possibility when consumers are presented with only a single consolidated price for the entire bundle—i.e. the seller does not disclose the prices of individual components. In this situation the consumer can mentally partition the consolidated bundle price in a manner that makes it easier to justify the act of purchasing the bundle. For instance the consumer can purchase a bundle consisting of a hedonic product and a utilitarian one by psychologically assigning a lesser price for the hedonic product to assuage any feeling of guilt associated with the purchase (thereby justifying the purchase). The act is reminiscent of self-price discrimination wherein a consumer pays different prices (albeit mentally construed) for the components although the total price remains constant under all circumstances. When consumers self-segment in this manner without persuasion from the firm in the form of advertisements or sales interactions the cost of selling may reduce for the firm. Further bundling may lower costs for a firm by reducing consumer heterogeneity. Considering the entire bundle as the unit of demand and analysis the same product (i.e. the bundle) can be sold to all consumers in the market regardless of the difference in their reservation prices for the individual bundle components so long the reservation prices are perfectly negatively correlated. In this regard bundling can be considered as the antithesis of segmentation a concept that provides the basic logic behind creating consumer segments such that consumers belonging to a particular segment are homogeneous but sufficiently heterogeneous across segments. This situation is paradoxical as on one hand bundling reduces consumer heterogeneity (i.e. the bundle can be sold to all consumers in the market) while on the other hand bundling thrives best under consumer heterogeneity (i.e. the greater the heterogeneity in the component reservation prices the higher the probability that bundling will earn greater profit compared with unbundling). Although pure bundles are rare in practice nothing prevents firms from creating product bundles by imaginatively combining products that provide greater value to the consumer through joint usage purchase or consumption. Creating such bundles is however not as trivial as setting prices for a price bundle; it requires managerial skill and a deeper understanding of consumer psychology and behaviour. Product bundling is thus better suited for competition. Price bundling or mixed bundling on the contrary being much easier to implement than product bundling remains a highly imitable strategy.Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) issues specific guidelines for sellers who use product bundling to sell merchandise on Amazon. In its product bundling policy Amazon mandates that the bundles that sellers intend to sell must consist of products that are highly complementary—i.e. the consumer must find greater value in the joint usage of the components in the bundle. Amazon further mandates that such a bundle should be listed under a unique product identifier and that none of the product identifiers from any of the components can be used to identify the bundle. In other words Amazon considers product bundles as unique products in themselves. Apart from aiming to provide greater value to consumers Amazon’s product bundling policy also serves the sellers’ interests. The assignment of unique product identifiers protects the bundle and the seller from adverse price competition by making it difficult for competitors to find and compete against the seller’s bundle listing. By virtue of its uniqueness a given product bundle may also enjoy a greater chance of being featured in Amazon’s coveted Buy Box. (Products featured in the Buy Box have a greater probability of being purchased by a consumer.) Multiple sellers offering the same product simultaneously compete for the Buy Box; only one is selected from among many to be featured in the Buy Box based on a set of criteria instated by Amazon. In summary by being unique a product bundle enjoys a better chance of being sold. In conclusion understanding how bundling works and simultaneously remaining cognizant about the limitations and applicability of the various bundling strategies thus discussed managers can use bundling to create greater value price discriminate and reduce costs thus improving profitability. What Is a Bundle and What Is Not a Bundle?Can a car comprising an engine a suspension system a chassis and wheels be considered a bundle? Or can a smartphone be considered a bundle when it as part of the same device offers the functionalities of a personal digital assistant a camera and a recorder over and above the ability to communicate with other users? Intuitively perhaps a car and a smartphone do not represent bundles but individual products. The examples of the car and the smartphone have a subtle difference: while a car cannot run without any of the components mentioned a cellular phone can still provide the basic functionality of a phone without the other components listed above. Although from this perspective the car may not constitute a bundle a smartphone can still be considered a bundle given that it combines separate products—a camera a personal digital assistant a recorder and so on—as part of the same device. However consumers necessarily expect and consider such features and functionalities to be integral parts of a smartphone—i.e. smartphones are not smartphones without such functionalities. Consequently product norms set by firms and as understood by consumers determine what constitutes a bundle (or not). At the core of this argument lies the perceived ability to separate components a factor that reflects the prevalent norm in the market. Such a norm is a joint outcome of a firm’s strategic marketing efforts and consumer preferences—i.e. an amalgamation of the market-driving and market-driven factors prevalent in the market fundamental to value creation.APPENDIX 1: COMPARISON OF TOTAL PROFITS FROM MIXED BUNDLING ACROSS TWO DIFFERENT CONSUMER SEGMENTSIn this appendix a histogram of maximum profit from a Monte Carlo simulation conducted with 100 random draws (or samples) from a population of normally distributed reservation prices using the template provided in Bundling Exercise B. The histogram is presented in Exhibit 6A. The average profit that could be earned from a population of consumers having normally distributed reservation prices a mean of 400 money units and a standard deviation of 10 money units was 6510 money units. In this example the average price commanded by the bundle was 693 money units and the prices for product 1 (P1) and product 2 (P2) were 367 money units and 379 money units respectively. The implication is that given the demand characteristics in the population a mixed bundling strategy would require firms to offer a 7.5 per cent price discount ([(367 + 379) − 693] ÷ 693) on the sum of the individual prices for P1 and P2. The simulation was repeated with a lower-dispersion parameter (i.e. standard deviation) value for consumers’ reservation prices across (not along) the bundle price line. All other parameters in the model remained unchanged. Dispersion was controlled by reducing the standard deviation pertaining to the error term. While the first run was conducted with a value of 50 money units for the standard deviation for the error term the second was conducted with a value of 5 money units for the same parameter. The histogram corresponding to the second run is presented in Exhibit 6B. The average profit that could be earned in this case was 6853 money units. In this example the average price commanded by the bundle was 692 money units and the prices for product 1 (P1) and 2 (P2) were 358 money units and 356 money units respectively. The implication is that given the demand characteristics in the population a mixed bundling strategy would require firms to offer a 3.2 per cent price discount ([(358 + 356) – 692] ÷ 692) on the sum of the individual prices for P1 and P2. An independent sample t-test conducted on the maximum profit data from the two populations returned a statistically significant difference at the 5 per cent level of significance indicating that the average maximum profit from a population of consumers having less dispersion across the bundle profit line is greater than the average maximum profit from a population of consumers having higher dispersion in reservation prices across the bundle price line. In other words bundling becomes a more potent method of price discrimination (and hence offers more profit) as the dispersion of consumers’ reservation prices decreases across the bundle price line. EXHIBIT 1A: PURE BUNDLINGBy charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle a firm can sell the bundle to all three consumers appropriate all the value from the market and make a profit of $30 (3 × $10). For the sake of simplicity and exposition the marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero. If the firm wanted to sell the jelly beans and the chocolate separately to all the consumers it would need to price the jelly beans at $1 and the chocolate also at $1. At these prices the firm will make a total profit of $6 ([3 × $1] + [3 × $1]). Therefore by bundling the firm can earn $24 more ($30 − $6) as compared to selling the jelly beans and chocolates separately.

For the sake of simplicity and exposition the marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero. If the firm wanted to sell the jelly beans and the chocolate separately to all the consumers it would need to price the jelly beans at $5 and the chocolate also at $5. At these prices the firm will make a total profit of $30 ([3 × $5] + [3 × $5]). Therefore by bundling the firm cannot earn any more than by selling the jelly beans and the chocolate separately (unbundling).

The marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero for the sake of simplicity and exposition. Next the profitability of the mixed bundling strategy is determined as follows:With a price bundling strategy by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle $8 for the jelly beans and $8 for the chocolate the firm can earn a total profit of $46 ([3 × $10] + [2 × $8]) or $16 more ($46 − $30) than the total profit that can be earned using pure bundling. Source: Created by author using hypothetical data.EXHIBIT 4: PRICE (MIXED) BUNDLING WITH POSITIVE MARGINAL COSTSWith a pure bundling strategy by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle the firm can sell the bundle to only four consumers and make a profit of $24 (4 × $6) wherein the marginal cost of production is assumed to be $2 for each of the two products. Source: Created by author using hypothetical data.Exhibit 4 (Continued)Next the profitability of the mixed bundling strategy is determined as follows:In a situation of price bundling by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle $8 for the jelly beans and $8 for the chocolate the firm can earn a total profit of $36 ([3 × $6] + [2 × $6] + [1 × $6]) or $12 more ($36 − $24) than the total profit that can be earned using pure bundling. Source: Created by author using hypothetical data.EXHIBIT 5: PRODUCT BUNDLINGWith a pure bundling strategy by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle the firm can sell the bundle to only two consumers and earn a profit of $20 (2 × $10). For the sake of simplicity and exposition the marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero. With a product bundling strategy however the desirability of milk and cookies increases by $2 as consumers find higher value in consuming milk and cookies together. The firm’s advertising may have been effective in persuading consumers to consider the greater enjoyment possible from consuming milk and cookies together. Thus by charging a price of $12 for the entire bundle the firm can now sell the bundle to all four consumers and earn a total profit of $48 (4 × $12) or $28 more ($48 − $20) than the total profit possible with pure bundling. Most importantly through product bundling the firm is also able to sell its products to consumers Rihaan and Roshni who consumed neither cookies nor milk to begin with.

Before returning to Canada to check on his first start-up he sat down at a Nairobi coffee shop to do a final assessment of all the data he had collected. Janssen had taken three unique approaches to learning more about Kenyan farmers: primary interviews a survey and his own attempt at chicken farming. He was pretty sure he knew what his new venture would offer the market but he wanted to review the data one more time. As he sipped on some coffee grown just outside of Nairobi and ate a chapati Janssen decided to use design thinking principles to synthesize the data and solidify the value proposition of his new undertaking.PRIMARY INTERVIEWSDuring the trip Janssen connected with people at all stages of the supply chain. Finding information was easy: Kenya had a strong culture of communal support. Janssen’s findings provided deeper insights into the macrodata he had previously reviewed. Some of Janssen’s key learnings pertained to the following.PopulationJanssen learned that a culture of land inheritance meant that farms remained small and therefore could not reap the benefits of scale (see Exhibit TN-1). As one farmer told Janssen “I have already split half my land among four of my children and the other half will go to the next four when they come of age.”Climate ChangeThe farmers also told Janssen about their experiences with the changing climate. To them it now seemed like every season was different from what they were used to. This made it difficult to effectively plan what to grow and it led to many farmers losing their crops to drought or torrential rain. The farmers Janssen met did not have the educational resources to find the technologies that would mitigate climate risk. Talking to one chicken farmer he was told A flood last fall destroyed much of our communities’ grain supply so the cost to feed my chickens has been high eliminating my profits! Some of my neighbours have begun feeding their chickens household food waste. For some this killed their chickens and for others it worked so I do not know if this is a good option!Market AccessJanssen spoke with farmers whose only means of selling outside their town was via a broker who visited seasonally with a non-negotiable price. While some of the coffee farmers Janssen met participated in co-operatives to improve their bargaining power he did not find similar arrangements between produce and livestock farmers. Janssen thought that there might be an opportunity to improve co-operation between these farmers similar to what had occurred in the coffee market. Some of the young start-up farmers that Janssen connected with in cities told him how they had mastered taking care of their fruits and vegetables but they could not find a consistent buyer who would purchase their produce in bulk. Yet when Janssen asked what they had done to promote their businesses the farmers had often spoken with their immediate community members but done little to formally market their products. Janssen knew that the demand existed because a vegetable canner in Nairobi had told him that his business frequently experienced shortages for the produce it processed. Janssen sensed that there were gaps in many farmers’ knowledge of how to participate in formal markets. Asking a few farmers if they had considered purchasing storage silos or water pumps provoked laughter: “No we can’t afford those. However recently many of us have been using credit to purchase fertilizers for our plants so we can harvest more.” Connecting with the microloan community in Nairobi revealed that the cost of performing due diligence in rural communities was generally considered the primary barrier to increasing the supply of capital for African farmers.Mobile PhonesJanssen was with the farmer Charles Mwangi one day when he came to truly appreciate the unique role that cell phones played in Kenyan society. A young man David Nganga approached Mwangi and Janssen because he had previously agreed to purchase a few of Mwangi’s chickens. After seeing the chickens Nganga and Mwangi exchanged a few words and Nganga left. “The deal fell through?” Janssen asked. Mwangi replied No David currently has his line of credit SIM card but does not want the bank to see the transaction on his account. You see Equity Bank [Equity Bank Kenya Limited] gave David a line of credit for buying fertilizer from a supplier in town but David doesn’t need fertilizer right now. So he is going to go to the fertilizer shop ‘to pay’ them and then they will give him cash to pay for the chickens. Janssen was with some dairy farmers one day when he saw how the growing prevalence of smartphones was affecting farming: “You see Janssen my friend who works at Tuskys [a Kenyan grocery chain] told me how cheese is growing in popularity. I used YouTube to learn how to make cheese and now I am turning a portion of my milk into cheese every week and selling it to a few restaurants in town.”EducationWhile harvesting maize with some women one afternoon Janssen learned about extension workers. He asked the women how they learned to farm: “We learned from our mothers and our fathers and from each other!” “Did any of you go to school for farming?” Jansen asked. “No but sometimes extension workers come by with information for us on how to improve our farms. The problem with them is that sometimes they demand money and they bring education that does not actually solve our problems.” University students shared with Janssen their dreams of working for large agrochemical and energy companies. Janssen could not help but feel like the universities were not training students to meet Kenya’s primary agricultural needs. He recalled when he had been conducting research on microfranchises in Nairobi after graduating university. Microfranchise owners had articulated to Janssen their goals of attending or sending their children to university and yet no one ever spoke of attending trade schools or technical colleges. One evening Janssen was talking with some friends he had made on the rooftop of his hostel’s restaurant. Atieno Barika and Collins were all unemployed university graduates who each ran several different businesses to earn their incomes. Atieno ran a small chicken farm in Nairobi as well as a fruit stand; Barika owned a plumbing installation company and vegetable plot; and Collins operated a butcher shop and managed a hotel. They all shared the same sentiment: “Our university educations did not teach us to do what we do now—we taught ourselves.” Janssen concluded that the tertiary education system in Kenya was improving people’s aptitude for learning and problem-solving but it was not disseminating the practical skills people needed to build the nation.Emerging Services for FarmersAlthough current start-ups were creating value for farmers Janssen felt that these services had two shortcomings: First they failed to leverage the strong sense of community that Janssen had been observing through his interactions in Kenya. Second the dominant services were SMS (short messaging service) based. SMS-based platforms would lose supremacy in the long term given the anticipated increase in the use of smartphones and mobile Internet networks.FURTHER RESEARCHSurveysJanssen performed a lean market research experiment using Facebook Ads and Google Forms. Using Facebook’s targeting capabilities Janssen promoted surveys to females and males aged 15–65 who had previously demonstrated an interest in farming through their “likes” and group memberships. Naming the company eLengo Janssen collected unique and valuable data on the needs of Kenyan farmers. “Lengo” meant “aim” or “target” in Kiswahili so it was a fitting name for a company aimed at helping farmers achieve their business goals. Janssen needed help estimating the potential market for a smartphone-based platform. Assume Kenya had a population of 55 million people 40 per cent of whom had a smartphone and that this data otherwise represented smartphone users in Kenya. What services could Janssen offer to what markets? Using this data for whom should Janssen design a minimum viable product (MVP)?  WhatsApp Messenger Minimum Viable Product Within the survey Janssen also invited people to join WhatsApp Messenger (WhatsApp) chat groups. Ninety-eight per cent of survey respondents signalled that they would like to join these groups. WhatsApp groups allowed Janssen to test his hypothesis which was that by bringing people with similar interests together and leveraging the Kenyan culture of communal support active communities would develop. With prompts from Janssen groups soon confirmed the hypothesis. Janssen began seeing the sharing of expertise and educational resources within the WhatsApp groups (see Exhibit TN-2).Chicken Farming ExperimentWith the survey revealing that chicken farmers would be the optimal first target market Janssen decided that if he was going to teach others how to raise chickens he should probably first learn how to raise them himself. Janssen asked his friend David Otieno if he would like to use his plot in Nairobi to try to raise chickens with Janssen providing the initial investment. Otieno agreed and Janssen arranged to send 50 chicks to Otieno’s plot. Janssen attempted to manage the farm remotely but it took only a few weeks to realize that raising a flock of healthy chickens was a genuine challenge. In week two temperatures dropped one night and 20 of the chicks died. This cold spell gave another 10 influenza killing them in the next two weeks. Just when Janssen thought that 20 birds may reach maturity Otieno called him one morning to report that almost all of the remaining birds had been attacked by some other animal in the night. With almost all of his birds now dead Janssen found a new appreciation for the challenges of raising animals.FINDING A VALUE PROPOSITIONAs Janssen finished his coffee he thought about how he knew the resources and processes he would be able to leverage but he needed to determine what value proposition he could offer the Kenyan agricultural market. Janssen considered which potential business models he should use to serve this market as well as which ones would be profitable. He decided to use design-thinking frameworks to identify key opportunities in the market.Exhibit TN-1: SurveysExhibit TN-1 (Continued)Exhibit TN-1 ContinuedSource: Adapted by the authors from Google Form surveys conducted by Chris Janssen ~April 25 2018.Exhibit 2: Sample WhatsApp ConversationSource: Adapted by the authors from WhatsApp conversation ~March 15 2018.,1.0,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,

It was pushing electric vehicles (EVs) because of its global commitments to control carbon emissions as well as its high dependence on imports to fuel its economic growth. India’s oil import bill in fiscal year (FY) 2017/18 was expected to be US$90 billion further rising to an estimated $160 billion by 2030. The spike in oil prices following the United States’ move to impose sanctions on Iran in May 2018 had given a new momentum to India’s ambitious EV program which aimed to reduce oil imports and pollution cut emissions and boost energy security.The government had launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 in 2013 to achieve national fuel security by promoting hybrid and EVs in the country. In the government’s annual budget for FY 2015/16 the NEMMP had initiated a scheme called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) which proposed achieving six million–seven million sales of hybrids and EVs in India year on year from 2020 onwards by providing various fiscal (e.g. tax holidays inexpensive land and power availability duty exemptions etc.) and non-fiscal incentives (e.g. waiving road tax and registration charges for electric vehicles) worth ₹87.3 billion to EV firms until 2020.Many Indian and foreign automobile firms were finding these initiatives very lucrative and were formulating strategies to aggressively foray into this proposed EV environment. One automobile firm that was quite optimistic about the Indian government’s EV endeavour was Mahindra Electric Mobility Limited (MEM). MEM was the pioneer of EV technology in India. Under the brand Mahindra Electric MEM had a wide variety of EVs spanning personal and commercial segments. According to MEM’s chief executive officer (CEO) Mahesh Babu the firm’s vision was “to become a leading brand in providing customised electric mobility experiences through cutting edge technology.” Babu’s vision was backed by MEM’s holistic efforts in creating a comprehensive road map for establishing a robust EV ecosystem.Though it seemed that there was a perfect fit between MEM’s vision and the Indian government’s EV initiative plans to seamlessly move to EVs ran the risk of total breakdown as multiple government departments were presenting disparate views on the EV road map creating confusion among stakeholders. In September 2018 many macro and micro issues were present in the overall environment that was being created for EVs. Would companies like MEM be able to effectively formulate strategies and compete successfully in this dynamic and changing business environment? COMPANY BACKGROUNDMEM was part of the Mahindra Group (Mahindra) conglomerate which was started in 1945 and had become a $19-billion global federation of companies by 2018. It operated in 20 key industries such as automobiles information technology financial services and hospitality many of which were fairly recent inceptions. Mahindra’s EV initiative began in 2010 when it acquired majority stake in Reva Electric Car Company India’s leading EV manufacturer at that time. The acquired firm was renamed Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles. By 2016 the firm had branched out to produce a wide variety of EVs. It had also entered powertrain and drivetrain technology and provided mobility solutions to enable shared electric mobility. As its product portfolio expanded (see Exhibit 1) the firm rebranded itself as Mahindra Electric Mobility (MEM). In FY 2017/18 MEM sold 4000 EVs nearly a third of which were cars; the rest were electric rickshaws and vans.Mahindra had planned to cumulatively invest ₹35–₹40 billion in MEM’s EV business out of which ₹8 billion was to be invested in product development and capacity expansion. Mahindra aimed to have at least four new EV models on the road by 2021. The remainder would be put toward developing a battery-module plant that would have the capacity to make half a million battery modules a year. The plant would also house a battery module pack line. In 2018 MEM joined hands with LG Chem Limited to develop lithium-ion batteries for its EVs. The entire facility for both module and pack was expected to begin production in the last quarter of FY 2020. The intent of the company was not only to drive and lead the EV market in India but also to act as a supplier of components. MEM was also developing infrastructure to support an electric-led mobility system. MEM EVs were expected to have an output in excess of 35 kilowatts (kW) per hour and would likely be priced at about ₹1.1 million.Anticipating higher demand MEM had commenced work towards increasing production capacity for EVs from 5000 units a year in 2018 to between 60000 and 70000 units a year. Despite the limited success of its EVs in the Indian market thus far the company was expecting huge demand from taxi operators and others in the fleet segment. In 2018 MEM had a pilot project running with 100 electric cars in association with Ola Cabs (Ola) a leading Indian cab aggregator in the central Indian city of Nagpur. It had formed a similar association with Uber Technologies Incorporated (Uber) to deploy EVs in the major Indian cities of Delhi and Hyderabad. MEM had already supplied 500 EVs to an electric-cab service provider Lithium Urban Technologies and had landed an order for 1000 electric cars from Bangalore-based fleet operator Baghirathi Travel Solutions. In addition MEM was partnering with Italian design house Pininfarina which Mahindra had acquired in December 2015 to develop an electric sports vehicle. MEM had also helped Ford Motor Company in developing an electric version of its Aspire entry-level sedan which would hit the market by 2019. In September 2017 the two companies had signed a memorandum of understanding to explore joint work on EVs and to approach global distribution as a team.Babu had been with Mahindra for 18 years and had worked in the design and development of engine and vehicle platforms—from frugal three-wheelers to Mahindra’s flagship models. He was a Fulbright scholar and had completed a program in leadership management at the Tepper School of Business Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Under his leadership MEM had launched four new models including the award-winning e2oPlus. Babu had been instrumental in shaping the electric-mobility solutions of the future through path-breaking initiatives in the commercial-fleet space and by expanding the electric portfolio of both low- and high-voltage drivetrains.THE INDIAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AND Electric vehiclesThe Indian automobile industry was worth $93 billion in 2018. It commanded 22 per cent of India’s manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) and contributed 7 per cent to the country’s overall GDP. The automobile industry and its over 10000 component manufacturers collectively employed about 30 million people. The firms in India had exclusive distributors for their range of vehicles and a multiple-brand distribution network in the automobile industry was not the norm. Nearly 70 per cent of passenger vehicles (PVs) sold in India fell into the category of small cars. Electric cars accounted for less than 0.1 per cent and overall EV sales were only 1 per cent of the 3.268 million passenger-vehicle sales in India in 2017. Ninety five percent of EVs on Indian roads were low-speed electric scooters powered by lead-acid batteries whose speed was less than 25 kilometres (km) per hour. In such a scenario the Indian government’s EV push was dictated by an urgent concern about rising pollution levels in most Indian cities in addition to its international carbon-reduction commitments and the pressure of the oil import bill.As a result of the government’s initiative it was expected that by 2030 as many as 40 per cent of new PVs to be sold in the local market would be EVs. Assuming a growth rate of 8 per cent in the PV segment every year about 71 million new vehicles were expected to be added between 2018 and 2030. Of this 28.4 million vehicles were expected to be EVs and the remaining 42.6 million would be equipped with conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs).This would lead to a massive technological shift as ICEs and EV engines had very different powertrains (see Exhibit 2). While a conventional ICE vehicle had 3000 moveable parts EVs only had 30 such parts. The configuration of EVs would be different from the ICE as the engine transmission and exhaust would be replaced with an electric motor inventors battery pack and control unit. Hence the electrical and electronics systems would take precedence over mechanical engineering. On the battery front the economics favoured lithium-ion batteries as their prices had dropped about 73 per cent—from $1000 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2010 to $272 per kWh in 2016. Lithium also had an advantage over oil because it could be recycled for future use. Battery price was an important consideration; creating battery-manufacturing capacity would take up a large part of the investment required to create EVs as nearly 70 per cent of the cost of an EV was contributed by the battery.Experts felt that the cost of batteries might halve by 2020 making EVs more affordable while driving the costs higher for conventional vehicles that had to comply with Bharat Stage 6 emission standards (comparable to Euro 6 emission standards). Hence they believed that EVs would become increasingly viable by 2023 with the Indian manufacturing ecosystem having matured by then. However many also felt that EV technology was still in the evolutionary phase and there were a lot of uncertainties with regards to cost structures and the evolution of the ecosystem. Between complete EVs and ICEs there was another set of vehicles which were called hybrids. These vehicles ran on both battery and ICE and could be an interim solution. INDIAN GOVERNMENT INITIATIVESTo lead from the front in its EV endeavour the Indian government created Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) in 2010 formed under the Ministry of Power. It was a joint venture of four national public sector undertakings: NTPC Limited Power Finance Corporation Limited Rural Electrification Corporation Limited and the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. EESL’s objective was to facilitate energy-efficiency projects that would significantly reduce energy consumption and costs. As part of its energy-conservation initiatives EESL had floated a tender for 10000 basic electric sedans in August 2017. Tata Motors Limited (TM) had cornered 60 per cent of the tender and the rest had gone to MEM. EESL had floated its second global tender for procuring 10000 electric cars in April 2018. In May 2018 the Union Ministry of Home Affairs was planning to seek guidance from EESL and switch to EVs replacing diesel-guzzling vehicles including heavy trucks and buses for the seven security forces operating under the ministry. In December 2017 the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises had sanctioned ₹4.4 billion to 11 states to procure 390 electric buses taxis and automobiles as a pilot project under the FAME scheme.To enhance the infrastructure for EVs in India in May 2018 the government proposed setting up EV charging stations every 3 kilometre (km) in cities with over a million people and every 50 km on busy national highways. For the further proliferation of EVs it planned to offer fiscal incentives and facilitated land acquisition for those who were interested in setting up the required EV-charging infrastructure. The government also considered providing subsidies to public sector undertakings in the energy sector such as NTPC Limited the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Indian Oil Corporation Limited to initiate the process of setting up charging stations. Besides these state-run enterprises Indian automakers including Mahindra and TM and cab-hailing companies like Ola and Uber were all interested in setting up charging infrastructure for EVs.As part of the ₹94-billion package for encouraging the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles among Indian consumers and cab aggregators the government was planning to offer incentives of up to ₹250000 for those who would scrap their old gasoline or diesel vehicles and purchase EVs (see Exhibit 3).To incentivize Indian manufacturers in April 2018 the government planned to double the mandatory local content in EVs to 70 per cent in the coming three years and to impose heavy duties on imports. In 2018 the local content in EVs was about 35 per cent as most companies imported batteries which accounted for a major cost of EVs. As per the proposal by 2019 the domestic content in EVs would be increased to a minimum of 50 per cent which subsequently would be increased to 60 per cent in 2020 and to 70 per cent in 2021. COMPETITORS IN THE INDIAN electric vehicles MARKETTata Motors LimitedTM was a part of the $100-billion Tata Group founded in 1868. TM itself was a $42-billion organization. It was a leading automobile manufacturer in India with a portfolio that included a wide range of cars sports vehicles trucks buses and defence vehicles. At the Geneva International Motor Show in March 2018 TM premiered its electric concept sedan—E-Vision—which was set to eventually become the brand’s flagship sedan in the Indian market. TM was operating on three different levels of electrification. The first was a plug-and-play solution with the Electra EV which would power lower-voltage vehicles like the Tiago Tigor Magic Iris and Ace. The next was to modify the new-age Omega architecture for electrification so as to offer longer-range and faster vehicles. Finally TM was looking at a dedicated EV architecture in the mid to long term. TM planned for the majority of its vehicles in India to be electrified by 2022 including mild hybrids hybrids and battery-operated EVs.TM had created an electric-mobility division to have special focus on developing cleaner mobility solutions for the future. Other firms of the Tata Group were roped in to offer a complete turnkey solution: While TM would offer the EV Tata Power Limited would set up charging stations; Tata Realty and Infrastructure Limited would build physical infrastructure depots or dedicated EV stations; and Tata Consultancy Services Limited would help develop the required software platform. TM had cornered 60 per cent of the EESL tender. However the electric cars it provided to EESL were only running 70 to 80 km on one charge compared to the initial claim of 130 km per charge. This made EESL question TM on performance criteria. With a price point of ₹1.12 million for each TM electric car this single-charge range was considered inadequate.Maruti Suzuki India LimitedStarted as a joint venture between the Indian government and the Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan in 1981 Maruti Suzuki India Limited (Suzuki) eventually became the largest car manufacturer in India. The Indian government later divested from this venture. In April 2018 Suzuki was the parent company’s most successful subsidiary in the world and at 50.10 per cent it had the largest market share among PVs in India. Suzuki along with Denso Corporation and Toshiba Corporation had pooled $180 million in 2017 to build a plant in India for producing lithium-ion batteries. Suzuki had also partnered with Japan’s largest carmaker Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) to roll out a small electric car for the mass segment in India and elsewhere by 2020. Its first affordable EV would be based on technology from parent Suzuki Motor Corporation and was to be made before the products that were going to be developed in partnership with Toyota. Thus the company was working with partners as well as focusing on in-house capabilities to put the ecosystem in place for EVs.Suzuki was likely to have an EV with a power output of 25 to 35 kW per hour suitable for the compact-car segment and possibly priced below ₹1 million. The company was looking for collaborations in the areas of materials handling battery recycling and reuse and charging infrastructure. In addition it would continue to refine its ICE vehicles and make them more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. Hyundai Motor India LimitedHyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Korean automobile manufacturer Hyundai Motor Company (HMC). Since its inception HMIL had been the second-largest car manufacturer and the number one car exporter in India. In FY 2017/18 HMIL had about a 17 per cent share in the Indian PV market. India was the third-biggest market for HMC globally behind China and the United States (outside its home market of South Korea) and its share in the company’s global revenue was about 15 per cent. The company sold 680000 million vehicles in FY 2017/18 (including exports). HMC was developing both battery EVs and fuel cell vehicles. HMIL was likely to introduce pure electric and hybrid vehicles in India in 2019—a year ahead of Suzuki. HMIL had developed hybrid vehicles for the domestic market but a spike in the goods and services tax rate for hybrid vehicles compelled the South Korean carmaker to shelve its hybrid vehicles completely and shift to electric ones. It would start with importing completely knocked down units of its Kona Electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) in 2019 and look at local manufacturing as the market matured. The Kona Electric would be priced between ₹2 million and ₹2.5 million. HMIL was planning to invest over $1 billion in India by 2020. HMC’s Kia Motor Corporation was also planning to manufacture an electric car and hatchback in India after its entry in the second half of 2019. However it believed there was a need to address critical issues such as establishing charging infrastructure in India.BYD Auto Company LimitedFounded in 1995 the Chinese firm BYD Auto Company Limited (BYD) was a listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Its automobile business included new-energy vehicles like EVs. In India BYD had teamed up with lesser-known Indian firm Goldstone Infratech to manufacture electric cars trucks and other automobiles with fast-charging batteries that could run up to 400 km on a full charge. In 2018 it planned to invest ₹2 billion in establishing a plant in India wanting to make the country its manufacturing hub for exporting EVs to other South Asian nations. BYD planned to manufacture 5000 electric buses per year in India by March 2021 and it would increase localization content to 70 per cent—which in 2018 stood at 35 per cent.Other Prospective PlayersIndian consumer durables maker Micromax Informatics Limited also planned to enter EV and battery manufacturing. It was in the advanced stages of testing formalities for the vehicles and had gotten approval for some of its lithium-ion batteries. It was keen on entering the electric two- and three-wheeler categories where it would compete with the likes of Bajaj Auto Limited Mahindra TVS Motor Company and Piaggio. Many other Indian firms—such as Hero Future Energies Limited Ravin Group Sun Mobility and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited—were also venturing into the domain of battery manufacturing for EVs. Being successful in this arena promised massive rewards as a study done by U.S.-based Rocky Mountain Institute estimated that switching completely to EVs in 2030 could create a battery market of $300 billion in India. If battery manufacturers imported the cells and assembled the battery they could capture only 30 per cent of this value whereas if they imported only the raw materials lithium and cobalt and manufactured the battery locally about 80 per cent of the value could be captured.In line with the Indian government’s push for EVs many foreign firms were also keen on taking initiatives. French company FM Logistic had plans to develop green vehicles for environmentally sustainable road cargo transportation in India. It planned to launch the first electric or hybrid truck in India in 2019. Japanese EV maker Terra Motors Corporation which sold electric rickshaws in the Indian market was looking to shift its operational base to India to expand in Asia. Terra Motors’ research and development centre in India would design products control quality and test specifications of EVs being manufactured in India. The company was looking to introduce in 2019 an electric two-wheeler powered by a lithium-ion battery. The start-up Uniti Sweden had formed a strategic partnership with the Bird Group for its foray into India. It was going to launch an affordable five-seater electric city car with a range of 250 km priced at about ₹250000 in 2020. Many other foreign players such as Renault-Nissan Honda Motor Company Limited Mercedes-Benz BMW Volvo Cars and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive had also expressed interest in bringing EVs into the Indian market but were awaiting clarity in government policy before finalizing their next course of action. According to a study conducted in 2016 by Variant Market Research the market in India for lithium-ion batteries was expected to reach $5 billion in 2024 and subsequently grow at 26 per cent a year. As a result many battery manufacturers from various countries like EnerBlu from the United States and Delta Electronics Industry from Taiwan were looking forward to supplying batteries for EV to Indian firms.INDIAN CONSUMERS’ PREFERENCES India was known as a small-car market. However the country was witnessing an SUV rush. In FY 2017/18 PV sales in India grew by 8 per cent to 3.28 million units whereas SUV sales grew by 21 per cent crossing 900000 units. In the pricier segment (₹1.2 million–₹4 million) three out of four cars sold in India were SUVs. From 14 per cent in FY 2009/10 the percentage share of SUVs in PV sales had risen to 30 per cent. Rising incomes and aspirations had led consumers to go from buying small cars to buying SUVs. By showing a preference for SUVs Indian consumers were behaving like their counterparts elsewhere in the world. SUVs had outpaced industry sales in many markets the world over. In Europe from a figure of just over half a million in 2000 SUV sales touched 4.6 million in 2017. The United States showed a jump in SUV sales from 3.4 million in 2000 to seven million in 2017. In the case of China the increase was more dramatic—from 4600 units in 2000 to 10.7 million in 2017. Between FY 2002/3 and FY 2017/8 SUV sales in India showed more than an eight-fold increase (see Exhibit 4). The thrust of SUVs in the forthcoming EV scenario had led companies such as Volvo Cars and BMW to provide hybrid-engine options. HMIL’s Kona Electric SUV would be the company’s first EV in India in 2019. Mercedes-Benz was working on the EQ concept EV range based on its GLC mid-size SUV. TM was designing electric versions of its off-roaders H5X and 45X. MEM was also working on an electric version of Mahindra’s popular KUV100 model.CONCERNSDespite the government’s heavy push experts felt that electric road transportation was yet to become viable in India due to the dearth of infrastructure primarily charging stations. There was concern as to how to electrify small cars and make them affordable. Many firms felt that as far as EVs were concerned there were three major challenges facing them: performance range and cost. According to Kenichi Ayukawa managing director and CEO of Maruti Suzuki making affordable electric cars was one of the biggest challenges for auto companies especially as vehicle batteries were very expensive and there was no public charging infrastructure. Expert opinion was that the ecosystem to manufacture the battery-management systems power electronics and lithium-ion batteries required for EVs was not yet available in India. On the other hand India’s northeastern neighbour China was already the world’s largest EV manufacturer with almost 60 per cent of the global market share in terms of volume (see Exhibit 5). With active policy support of the Chinese government and large investments in the new-energy space China was likely to emerge as a trendsetter and significant technology driver in the EV arena in coming years. It was also expected to create a huge ecosystem for battery manufacturing recycling and charging infrastructure as well as other related components of the EV package. It was believed that in the future India would have to depend on China for battery imports and that ultimately Chinese companies would dominate the Indian market. This was already being seen in many instances. French carmaker Groupe Renault’s electric version of the Kwid small car intended for India would have batteries and battery-management systems manufactured in China. The current market trend was also showing an increase in the import of automobile parts from China (see Exhibit 6).Experts were also skeptical about the proliferation of EV usage reducing India’s pollution levels as the country met 75 per cent of its electricity needs by burning fossil fuels. It was felt that EVs on roads would only move the pollution off city roads to its hinterlands where the required power was generated. In addition to this for a power-deficit nation like India there would be challenges in ensuring adequate supplies needed to run EVs. Besides issues related to charging infrastructure the need for fast chargers parking spots and swappable batteries required robust solutions and public–private partnerships. Experts felt that the push for EVs was largely coming from the central government and there had been limited policy-level support at the state and municipal levels.The Indian automotive industry came under the purview of the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises and ministries of road transport and highways. It had faced the brunt of intervention from various regulatory bodies in India like the National Green Tribunal; the Supreme Court; the Goods and Services Tax Council; the National Institution for Transforming India; and the ministries of urban development power and environment and forests. This had led to multiple voices sending out multiple messages creating an environment of confusion and uncertainty for the industry.Besides stressing EV usage in 2016 the Indian government also decided that the country would leapfrog from BS 4 emission standards to BS 6 emission standards for all of its gasoline- and diesel-driven vehicles by 2020 which warrantied an investment of more than ₹600 billion. This further stressed the budgets of the research and development departments of many automobile manufacturers including MEM which had to work on both EV- and BS 6-compatible engines for the Indian market. With intensifying competition and a success ratio of just two in every 10 new models introduced in the market return on investment and viability were serious challenges ahead for the vehicle makers.There was also a fear that the industry would be shaken up as close to 60 per cent of automobile industry revenue came from engines and powertrains which would be under threat in the upcoming EV scenario. There was danger that an EV-based automobile environment in India would make many of the casting forging and machining sectors unviable risking about 1.5 million jobs in an already job-stressed Indian market.the WAY FORWARDIn its endeavour to shift 30 per cent of the country’s transport fleet to electric by 2030 the Indian government had initiated plans to provide many incentives to public and private enterprises as well as Indian consumers. Despite the multitude of government initiatives and the serious attempts being made by many automotive firms in India there was still a lack of clarity regarding the various macro- and micro-environmental factors that had to be addressed to make the EV dream a reality in India. As this change in business environment became imminent Babu realized that he would need to study competitors’ initiatives and that MEM would have to formulate its own strategies.

This was the third time in the span of a year that KPMG partners had quit to join rival companies and this exodus was the biggest movement of consulting employees since 2011. This time Deloitte had delivered a big blow to KPMG—hitting its advisory services which were growing rapidly and contributed 38 per cent to its global revenue. Globally KPMG’s advisory services were growing at 11.5 per cent—much faster than its other two functions tax and auditing which grew at 8.8 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively in 2016. Deloitte gained significantly from this move and emerged as a challenger to Ernst & Young Global Limited (EY) which had the biggest advisory vertical in India with 125 partners. Reeling from the blow the firm had received KPMG management was confronted with the challenge of warding off future poaching attempts and retaining its existing partners. The standard practices to check attrition such as non-compete agreements and non-solicitation contracts had become ineffective for KPMG in this situation.KPMGKPMG was founded in 1987 through the merger of Peat Marwick International and Klynveld Main Goerdeler and the name KPMG carried the traces of its founding members. Headquartered in Amsterdam the Netherlands the company was one of the world’s Big Four accounting firms. The other three were Deloitte PwC and EY. Driven by its vision to create “a platform which shared the expertise knowledge and experience of professionals across a global network” the company had been helping to build a knowledge-based economy using its expertise and resources.Members of the Swiss KPMG International Cooperative operated as separate legal entities in many countries. The firm offered three major lines of service: audit taxation and advising. Of these auditing was a major service for the company. Its advisory services comprised management consulting risk consulting and deal advising (see Exhibit 1). The firm also provided the latest technology and information services; to help grow its clients’ businesses KPMG provided them with SAP and Oracle consulting services. Globally the company competed aggressively in the market to win clients.In 2010 KPMG was recognized as the world’s most attractive employer among the Big Four firms. In 2016 its total employee strength across the globe was around 174000 people. With revenues of US$25.42 billion KPMG saw a 9.6 per cent increase in its overall earnings that year. However the Europe Middle East and Africa region including India grew by only 6 per cent. KPMG IndiaIn 1993 KPMG entered India and spread to all major cities including Ahmedabad Bengaluru Chandigarh Chennai Gurugram Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Mumbai Pune Noida and Vadodara. The company offered its clients financial and business advisory services risk advisory services and tax and regulatory services. Serving these needs of Indian businesses it created a client base of over 2700 companies in India by 2016 and emerged as one of the leading consultancy firms in the domains it served. Its client list included information technology companies financial services companies and market leaders in several other industry segments. Led by talented professionals in the domain of advisory services the company had edged ahead of its competitors. In 2015 KPMG India won the prestigious “System Integration Partner of the Year” award from QlikTech a leading new-generation business intelligence and analytics platform that offered its clients CXO-level applications and dashboards giving insights into their business operations. Over the years KPMG India had emerged as a top employer and had a strong human resource base of around 10000 employees. LinkedIn listed KPMG as the fifth most attractive company that Indian talent was willing to work with in 2016. Both current and former employees had posted positive views about the company on various online portals highlighting the opportunities it offered for learning and working on challenging projects leading to career growth.  Competition: The Big FourPwC EY Deloitte and KPMG were globally at the forefront of accounting-related services and were known as the Big Four (see Exhibit 2). These firms dominated the industry by their sheer size and global presence. They had a high reputation in the industry as they performed audit tax consulting and transactions services for the many Fortune 500 companies that were their clients.DeloitteBased in New York United States Deloitte was a 150-year-old firm with a presence in more than 150 countries. With its strong network of around 244000 professionals the firm earned $36.8 billion in 2016. By that time the company had been featured 17 times in Fortune’s list of 100 best companies to work for. Deloitte employees enjoyed benefits like telecommuting job sharing compressed workweeks fully paid sabbaticals and on-site medical care facilities. In India the company was first incorporated as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Private Limited (DTTIPL) a private company. In October 2015 the firm became Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP a limited liability partnership. PwC Founded by Samuel Lowell Price in 1849 London-based PwC operated in 157 countries with a large network of 223468 executives. Serving 422 of the world’s Fortune 500 companies the company posted revenues of $35.9 billion in 2016. Ranked 53 on the Fortune 100 list in 2016 the company paid an average of $104772 to salaried employees in the most common jobs. Some of the benefits of working with PwC were unlimited sick days job sharing compressed workweeks fully paid sabbaticals health insurance and sick days even for part-time workers. Incorporated in 2009 in India the firm spread to several large cities including Ahmedabad Bengaluru Chennai Delhi Hyderabad Kolkata Mumbai and Pune.EYA company of about 212000 employees EY had operations in 82 locations and $29.6 billion in revenue globally. Ranked 49 on the Fortune 100 list this Big Four firm offered several options that allowed its employees to work when and where they wanted. Some of the benefits its employees received were telecommuting job sharing compressed workweeks fully paid sabbaticals and discounted gym memberships. Sick leave however was limited to 10 days in a year. The company allowed its employees the freedom to enjoy life’s small wonders as they could take 16 weeks off for parental leave. In India a strong network of 22000 employees worked from various strategic locations namely Chandigarh Kochi Mumbai Bangalore Kolkata Hyderabad Chennai Ahmedabad and Pune; the company’s Indian headquarters were at Gurugram in the national capital region.As an emerging market with audit consulting and advisory services valued at around ₹100 billion ($1492 million) the India market—which was growing at around 10 per cent—was attractive to the Big Four firms and they were each vying for a large share in this market. PwC had recorded revenue growth of 17 per cent for financial year 2015 and was optimistic of growth opportunities in India. During this period EY also reported a spike in its revenue growth to 19.7 per cent and was looking at sourcing 30 per cent of its total revenue from emerging markets including India. Even Deloitte and KPMG encouraged by their fast growth over the years considered India a bright spot for increasing their global revenues.The Poaching EpisodeIn October 2016 when most of the audit firms were making desperate attempts to check attrition Deloitte waged a war to gain a competitive edge in the Indian advisory vertical. It poached 20 partners from KPMG and tried to woo around 300 executives away from the company. Deloitte was purportedly giving the poached executives a significant raise from their current salaries: these partners were offered a salary jump in proportion to the number of team members they could bring from KPMG. This exodus came as a big blow to KPMG especially its advisory services. There was speculation that Deloitte would gain significantly from this movement of partners once these 300 executives had been recruited. While Deloitte already had 55 partners in its advisory vertical the addition of 20 more new partners could take this number closer to EY’s total of 125. With this increased strength Deloitte emerged as a challenger to EY in the advisory practice space. This exodus was the third time within the span of a year that a large number of KPMG partners had quit. Earlier in August 2016 a senior partner had quit KPMG and joined a tax advisory firm run by Dinesh Kanabar a former deputy chief executive officer (CEO) at KPMG. Competitors had also tried to poach the indirect tax team earlier in 2016 by giving each of the team members offers to join them.After this episode Richard Rekhy the elected head of KPMG India decided to retire as CEO of KPMG India well ahead of the end of his second term in November 2020. Rising from the position of the head of risk advisory practice Rekhy had been at the helm of KPMG India since 2012. The mass resignations which had raised questions about his management style led to his retirement. Later the leader of the advisory vertical Ambarish Dasgupta also stepped down. The consultancy business had seen consolidation over the past few years. While some consulting firms were acquired by either the Big Four firms or technology companies many stand-alone firms struggled with revenue and retaining their best talent. Deloitte had been aggressively looking for expansion opportunities in the advisory business and this poaching move was in line with those efforts. Culture at Warring FirmsKPMG had built itself on the principles of integrity openness honesty and flexibility. The company promoted diversity in the workplace and encouraged sharing of knowledge among employees. It was recognized on various social media sites and job portals for its reputation and competitive pay package and for its employees who were described as intelligent talented friendly and down to earth. Posters on these sites said the company had good training and career advancement opportunities. However posters also reported some disadvantages of working with the firm including long working hours (including working on weekends) limited leaves and time-bound projects. Additionally some employees felt they spent too much time travelling and experienced sustained pressure to acquire many skill sets owing to the small size of several teams. Several people from KPMG complained of long working hours and especially of unpredictably annoying schedules between January and April every year rating the company as the least prestigious among the Big Four. A few also talked of lower compensation. In a survey by Vault.com Inc. (Vault) one former KPMG employee observed “Work hours can be very long sometimes depending on the client you get. Investment banking hours with accountant pay can be discouraging and frustrating.” A former employee noted on the Indeed site that the company “overall provides a degree of freedom for individuals to perform but internal employee and talent management processes at least in India are pretty hazy.” Another senior consultant posted about disadvantages of working with the company: “constant travel poor work life balance. No value to others’ time.”On the other hand Deloitte had created an organizational culture of purpose which was aimed at guiding behaviour influencing strategy and transcending leaders. In India its former and current employees had described the workplace as friendly and compassionate. Many of them felt the company gave them a sense of prestige and fostered their professional growth. People working with Deloitte were described as “top-notch highly talented very intelligent.” In the Vault survey from 2016 the company received positive votes for its culture people and opportunities provided in the workplace. It received negative votes especially for long hours lack of focus on regional travel and lack of early global deployment opportunities.Retention PracticesDespite existing retention policies 800 middle and senior executives were reported to have moved to competing firms in 2016. The industry attrition rate was 30–40 per cent higher over the past two to three years. The joining bonus for new executives was equal to a one-year salary which took care of the amount held back by the previous employer. Such employees were lured by fixed appraisals for the next two years irrespective of their performance.  On the other hand the Big Four and other consulting firms offered anywhere between a 30 and 50 per cent jump in salaries to those executives who were poached by competing firms. At times the firms elevated the status of such executives to the level of salaried partners to retain them. To incentivize the partners the firms were also ready to offer the partners 100 per cent of their salaries rather than putting 25 per cent toward capital which had been a typical practice. In addition to these preventive measures the Big Four made the exit rules for employees much stricter. In 2015 consultancies tried to restrict their executives from quitting with newer clauses in their employment contracts which extended the notice period by several months. Accounting firms made such restrictions to ensure that the partners did not poach whole teams leak confidential information or take business away with them. Some firms took even stricter measures to make movement more difficult. Gardening leave had often been waived in the past but the companies stopped waiving this to check attrition. A senior partner who was on gardening leave in 2015 noted “My bonus was held back by my old firm. It was not a small amount it ran into several [tens of millions].”Despite frequent instances of poaching PwC did not extend the notice period. Deepak Kapoor chairman of PwC India said “In PwC we have had a six-month notice period policy for many years for partners and we are not planning to change it. On a philosophical level I firmly believe that everyone should have a right of choice where they want to work.”ClosingHaving incurred losses in the audit business the Big Four firms were looking to expand their advisory businesses. The exodus of 20 partners and 300 other employees posed a challenge to the advisory business of KPMG. A leaner advisory team had dented the company’s competitive edge. Owing to these factors KPMG was forced to focus on resolving its internal issues at a time when the competition focused on clients and industry-related activities. Industry experts believed that poaching was the last resort for any firm but this practice prevailed because the industry did not have enough trained people. The competition could become more intense as this industry was projected to double in size by 2020. Facing the threat of more losses the new leadership at KPMG India had to find ways to retain its partners and defend against any future poaching attempts.

(Xiaomi) in Beijing delivered a speech at Xiaomi’s annual meeting. Lei summed up the company’s performance over the past year but expressed that he was not happy; the company’s efforts had failed to fulfill Lei’s expectations and it led him to reflect on his entrepreneurship journey.Six years earlier 14 people had come together at Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park to start Xiaomi. In time Xiaomi emerged as the leader in the Chinese smartphone market storming its way to the top. Xiaomi had adopted Lei’s “flying pig” theory—the importance of seizing the right opportunity—and Lei’s belief that the Internet was a new methodology that required an advanced way of thinking—focused extreme rapid using word of mouth and user involved. Xiaomi’s approach became a model for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to learn from and emulate. However there was fierce competition in the smartphone business in China. It was not long before Xiaomi encountered opposition from its allies and partner companies. Their products slogans and release conventions all attacked Xiaomi. Some engaged in Pengci marketing that targeted Xiaomi; some companies outright claimed that their products were better than Xiaomi’s. As Xiaomi lost ground it was further subjected to queries insults and slander. Even the accomplished and powerful chair of Gree Electric Dong Mingzhu joined the melee. Xiaomi’s overseas market encountered troubles and the Xiaomi brand suffered a trust crisis. Taiwan fined Xiaomi for misleading consumers with incorrect sales figures and the company was sued for product patent deficiency in India. These problems left Lei feeling dejected. How could Xiaomi meet the challenge of increasing its sales in the international markets?XiaomiWhen Lei was a student at Wuhan University he was impressed by the image of Steve Jobs presented in the book Fire in the Valley and was determined to start his own international corporation. After being CEO at Kingsoft Office for a number of years and an angel investor Lei began to pursue his dream which he had conceptualized 20 years earlier. He saw a space between the costly international-brand smartphones and the inexpensive made-in-China phones and he started Xiaomi with some of his like-minded friends to enter that space. The company’s name—the Chinese word for “millet” a nutritious and inexpensive Chinese staple—reflected the founders’ interest in providing useful products that were affordable. Core Hardware ProductsXiaomi smartphones (including Xiaomi pads) Xiaomi TV (including Xiaomi set-top box) and Xiaomi router were the first business ventures. Xiaomi then developed a smartphone operating system in collaboration with users of its online forum. The phones were also marketed through Xiaomi forum and sold online at MI.com which made Xiaomi phones the first Internet smartphone brand. Xiaomi continued to market sell and develop through these Internet platforms.Xiaomi smartphones achieved terrific growth increasing from a sales volume of 300000 handsets in 2011 to sales of 70.8 million in 2015 an increase of over 200 times. This made Xiaomi the fifth-largest smartphone company in the world after Samsung Group Apple Inc. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and Lenovo Group Ltd. Due to the popularity of the smartphone the number of users of Xiaomi’s firmware operating system Mi User Interface (MIUI) also increased to an astonishing figure of 170 million spread over 156 countries around the world.Xiaomi box and Xiaomi TV also served as important ports to attract new users. This was facilitated by high-performance hardware configuration a smooth operating system and much original film and TV content. Xiaomi released its routers to create a cross-platform data centre which enabled users to get data and information from different devices whenever and wherever they needed.Mi User InterfaceXiaomi’s Mi User Interface (MIUI) and its mobile Internet services were the second part of Xiaomi’s “software + hardware + internet” business ecosystem. MIUI was a firmware operating system for mobile devices based on Google’s Android operating system. MIUI had two important features: it could be upgraded swiftly using either a developer’s version that was upgraded weekly or a stable version that was upgraded monthly; and the coding was available as software that could be installed on any Android phone which meant that not only Xiaomi phones but also other Android devices could switch to MIUI.In addition to providing access to the Internet MIUI offered Internet-based services such as intelligent call notification free Wi-Fi unknown number identification and an application store. MIUI also offered comprehensive Internet-based services such as Xiaomi Lifestyle which offered retail products and discounts at restaurants theatres and other venues; Xiaomi Entertainment which provided mainly games and films plus some TV content; and comprehensive financial services for loan financing. All these features had enough potential to generate more income sources for Xiaomi. In 2015 the revenues from Xiaomi Internet services reached CN¥3.82 billion (US$564 million) which was a 150 per cent increase compared to the previous year.Smart Hardware InvestmentXiaomi planned to invest ¥33.9 billion (US$5 billion) in 100 smart hardware companies. Lei pinned his hopes on the smartphone which was the mandatory device that connected all household computerized equipment in the internetworked Internet of Things. Xiaomi gradually built a hardware ecosystem that focused on mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) set-top boxes for televisions and smart routers.By early 2016 Xiaomi had invested in 55 smart hardware companies including Huami (wearable technology such as the Mi Band) Qingmi Technology Co. Ltd. (hardware interface devices such as patch boards and cables) Ninebot Inc. (personal transportation devices) Lanmi Technology (Bluetooth devices such as headphones) Zimi Corporation (power banks) Zhimi Technology (air purifiers and fans) and Yunmi Technology (water purifiers). By mid-2016 Xiaomi had already made cumulative shipments of 24 million Mi Band units making Huami the second-largest smart wearable devices company in the world. As a result of the popularity of the Mi Band Huami raised ¥237.3 million (US$35 million) in its Series B round of financing; Huami was seeking to start a new round of financing with a valuation of ¥6.8 billion (US$1 billion).Development of XiaomiWithin its first five years Xiaomi raised five rounds of financing (see Exhibit 1) and its valuation rose from ¥1.7 billion (US$250 million) to ¥305 billion (US$45 billion)—a whopping 179-time increase. This meant that Xiaomi had the highest valuation in the world among unlisted technology companies. Yuri Milner the founder of Digital Sky Technologies Global (DST) who had invested in Facebook Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (US$100 billion companies) assessed Xiaomi’s valuation as having the potential to reach ¥678 billion (US$100 billion).Background of the smartphone businessDevelopment Situation of SmartphoneUnlike feature phones smartphones had an independent operating system. The operating system extended a phone’s basic communication functions by allowing installation of new applications (apps). These enhanced functions mainly depended upon the development of mobile Internet.With the development of technology smartphone functions became more and more powerful allowing many tasks that were normally carried out on a desktop computer to be accomplished on the phone. The feature phone market was gradually being taken over by smartphones. According to the technology research firm Gartner Inc. the total global sales of all mobile phones grew from 1.22 billion units in 2008 to 1.917 billion units in 2015. Shipments of smartphones increased from 140 million to 1.39 billion units while global sales of feature phones decreased from 1.14 billion to 570 million units.The Internationalization of Smartphone BrandsSamsung and Apple were the giants in the smartphone business. According to statistics provided by Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. in 2015 Samsung commanded 23.9 per cent of the world’s smartphone sales and Apple 17.2 per cent. However Apple garnered 91 per cent of the profits of the world’s smartphone sales while Samsung took only 14 per cent. Many smartphone manufacturers were incurring losses.Samsung’s core ability lay in its smartphone vertical industry chain. The company’s key techniques for manufacturing computer chips random-access memory (RAM) data storage screens and other components gave Samsung advantages in product development production quality and price. Samsung launched phones of numerous kinds and levels. Phones with different hardware and at different price points were produced around the globe and heavily promoted with celebrities sportspersons and non-commercial advertisements. The phones were sold internationally through many channels (through agents and direct to consumers who could customize their phones). After earning additional profits and establishing its production cycle Samsung continuously reduced the prices of its old phones to stay in the market and developed new models to replace the old ones.In contrast Apple used the strategy of single-product explosions launching only two or three new phones each year. Apple’s general headquarters was situated in the United States. It focused on design and development of its products purchased raw materials and components from more than 500 enterprises in 31 different countries and completed the assembly process in Foxconn China. The products were then delivered by air transport to various distribution centres around the world. After new products were released at a convention Apple’s iPhones were sold through individual retail traders mass retail traders operators and Apple stores. The relatively high price of iPhones and their consistent popularity around the world brought tremendous profits for Apple.The Internationalization of Chinese Smartphone BrandsThe first Chinese smartphone brands that tried to internationalize were Huawei and ZTE Corporation. They established good business relationships with foreign operators by providing telecommunications infrastructure or producing phones for them. Those foreign operators had abundant users channels and resources which provided Chinese brands with many advantages in broadening their markets. Lenovo accelerated its internationalization in smartphones by purchasing Motorola Inc. for US$2.9 billion. Lenovo acquired 2000 patent rights owned by Motorola and enjoyed 16000 patents owned by Google in addition to acquiring Motorola’s mobile brand trademark portfolios and corporate relationships with more than 50 operators around the world. Coolpad Group Limited (Coolpad) increased its core competitive power by establishing research centres in the United States and India. Coolpad’s dual-SIM dual-standby phone had a leading edge in the smartphone business as a result of its communication-based technology dual system phone security user interface (UI) design and mobile Internet services. Gionee increased its brand popularity by sponsoring the Kolkata Knight Riders a celebrity-owned cricket team that played in the Indian Premier League and establishing and funding a charity that supported under-privileged children diagnosed with leukemia. Arvind Vohra CEO and managing director of Gionee India led Gionee in signing contracts with 10 agencies and developing 35000 Gionee retail stores in India. OnePlus had targeted global markets since its inception. Its invitation system of marketing (similar to that used by Google Glass) delivered OnePlus phones to markets in 17 countries including the United States Great Britain France Germany Italy and India.Xiaomi’s internationalization practiceInternationalization as Both a Dream and a GoalAlthough China was becoming the world’s most influential smartphone market the Chinese market was becoming saturated. China had been in a period of high-speed development of smartphones since 2010. Smartphone shipments grew by 100 per cent each year for the next three years but in 2013 the smartphone market began to decline dramatically. At the end of 2015 the number of phone users in China had reached 1.32 billion about 95 per cent of China’s population. There was almost no room left for the market to grow. With the need for phone replacements decreasing the development of smartphones entered a passive state. The phone business had already completed its regeneration and upgraded at an accelerated speed; the transformation from functional phone to smartphone was basically completed. In the future the development of the smartphone business could only rely on upgrades or regeneration of smartphones.As a result of a gradually saturated market the battle among Chinese smartphone brands was becoming more and more fierce. Many of the vendors who lacked brand popularity innovative power core patents and government allowances were eliminated from the market. Companies like Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp. (LeEco) Meizu Technology Co. Ltd. Coolpad and Lenovo followed Xiaomi by offering similar products at the same price quality and functionality. They came out with good phones at attractive prices which in turn slowly weakened Xiaomi’s competitive power. Xiaomi had captured as much of the market as it could. Xiaomi’s total phone shipments in 2015 did not achieve the company’s target; only 70.8 million Xiaomi phones were sold in that year. That was an increase of 22.8 per cent from 2014 but the year-on-year growth rate in 2014 was 227 per cent. In addition Xiaomi’s relatively low average price and extremely low profit margin had already put Xiaomi in a critical situation. According to a survey completed by International Data Corporation (IDC) the average selling price of a Xiaomi phone in China was US$141 in 2015 while the average selling price of phones produced by Huawei OPPO Electronics Corp. and Vivo Communication Technology Ltd. was US$213 US$231 and US$208 respectively. Considering that the market situation for Xiaomi was alarming and its profit insufficient to support the corporation itself Lei intended to enter the international market rapidly to accelerate Xiaomi’s development and accomplish his dream of internationalization.Xiaomi’s Internationalization TeamIn order to enter the overseas markets Xiaomi initially formed an international management team. In addition to Xiaomi’s eight founders Xiaomi welcomed seven team members with senior work experience in well-known international companies such as Google Tencent and Qualcomm. The team had four foreigners and six people from China returning from overseas work (see Exhibit 2).Xiaomi in Hong Kong and TaiwanBecause Hong Kong and Taiwan were physically close to Mainland China and their systems cultures and commercial traditions were almost identical to that of Mainland China Bin Lin Xiaomi’s international affairs manager targeted the “circle of Chinese culture” markets as Xiaomi’s first overseas attempt. In April 2013 Xiaomi officially initiated its internationalization process.At first Xiaomi tried to sell its products through e-commerce platforms in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong users could buy Xiaomi phones from the Xiaomi website using PayPal for payment. The phones were delivered from Shenzhen to Hong Kong within three days by S.F. Express Inc. Taiwanese consumers could buy Xiaomi phones from the Xiaomi website paying with eATM (a process similar to electronic banking) credit card PayPal or 7-Eleven Bill Pay. At first the delivery process to Taiwan was similar to that for Hong Kong. Later Xiaomi established its own warehouse in Taiwan and goods were delivered by T-Cat Express Delivery Service from the warehouse to anywhere in Taiwan (with the exception of some remote areas) within 24 hours.In addition to promoting phones on its own website Xiaomi also collaborated with local operators and e-commerce platforms. Hong Kong Telecommunications Limited was the first dealer to carry Xiaomi phones in Hong Kong. Consumers could purchase Xiaomi phones from Hong Kong Telecom by Internet or telephone order or in an offline store. In Taiwan Xiaomi first collaborated with FarEasTone Telecommunications. In Taipei Gaoxiong and Yilan advertisements for contract-free Xiaomi phones were on almost every taxi. Xiaomi next established collaborative relationships with Chunghwa Telecom Taiwan Star Telecom and the biggest electronic platform in Taiwan PChome Online Inc.In order to provide better services and communicate with users Xiaomi opened its MIUI forum and Facebook account for Xiaomi fans in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Moreover Xiaomi organized many kinds of offline activities to interact with users. To improve users’ experience Xiaomi was planning to build “Xiaomi homes” and “Xiaomi smart appliance experience halls” in Hong Kong and Taiwan.Xiaomi in India and Southeast AsiaAfter gaining some experience in Hong Kong and Taiwan Xiaomi made plans to enter larger markets. After a comprehensive evaluation three factors emerged for the choice of new markets: the proportion of young people in the population a fast-growing period of e-commerce and operators’ relatively weak control over phone-selling channels. Lin decided to focus on the Indian and Southeast Asian markets first.In 2014 Xiaomi started to sell its phones and smart hardware in Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Thailand the Philippines and India. First Xiaomi launched its official website in these countries and partnered with local e-commerce platforms. For example Xiaomi initially signed up exclusively with Flipkart which was the biggest e-commerce platform in India and then established strategic relationships with two major e-commerce platforms Amazon.com Inc. and Snapdeal. Second Xiaomi established an overseas service team and outsourced after-sales services to local companies. For instance after-sales service in India was outsourced to GadgetWood eServices Pvt. Ltd. Third after considering the underdeveloped logistics and payment systems Xiaomi reached an agreement with electronic commercial platform Lazada Group to sell Xiaomi phones in the Philippines Indonesia and Malaysia. Lazada built a giant warehouse for Xiaomi in those countries and established internal transportation teams to deliver Xiaomi phones to the consumers the very next day. The popularity of credit cards in Southeast Asia was comparatively low so Lazada allowed its consumers to use electronic bank payments cash on delivery and other modes of payment. Moreover Lazada provided customer services in the local language.In India Xiaomi not only tried to promote its smartphones by using full-page newspaper advertisements but it also organized large “Xiaomi fan festivals.” Xiaomi attracted more people to take advantage of time-limited and quantity-limited discounts on different products. At the Xiaomi 4i release convention in New Delhi for the first time Lei greeted his Indian Xiaomi fans by repeating the same words in his imperfect English with a heavy Hubei accent: “Are you OK?” A video clip of the greeting was adapted into many different versions and went viral on the Internet—a perfect viral marketing campaign for Xiaomi.Permeating Other MarketsIn 2015 Xiaomi continued to explore the overseas markets but cautiously; the progress decelerated. On February 12 2015 Xiaomi held a low-key meeting with U.S. press at the W San Francisco Hotel but Xiaomi only opened its smart hardware—including the power bank Mi band and in-ear headphones—for sale in the United States. All products were to be delivered from China to U.S. consumers within seven working days if possible. There was no free delivery service (the cost of delivery was US$5 plus US$10 for every 500 grams) and custom duties were to be paid by the consumer. After three months Xiaomi released its products in the United Kingdom Germany and France. The product type and the mode of sales deliveries and payments were similar to those employed in the United States. On June 30 2015 Xiaomi held a grand launch ceremony in São Paulo Brazil and presented a series of products including the Redmi 2 smartphone to Brazilian consumers. In September 2015 Xiaomi reached an agreement with Mobile in Africa (MIA) Group to provide selling marketing and after-sale service in 50 countries in sub-Saharan Africa before the end of 2015. Xiaomi’s first release in Africa was limited to the Redmi 2 and Xiaomi Mi 4 smartphones available in South Africa Kenya and Nigeria.Xiaomi’s internationalization dilemmaTrust CrisisXiaomi held three Internet purchasing activities in Taiwan in December 2013—flash sales that offered a specified number of phones (10000 10000 and 8000 respectively) at a discounted price. The marketing known as “hunger marketing” was meant to use a fast sell-out to enhance the perceived popularity and value of the phones. According to Xiaomi each purchasing event sold out in minutes: 9 minutes and 50 seconds for the first event 1 minute and 8 seconds for the second and 25 seconds for the third. Xiaomi claimed that a total of 28000 phones were sold over the three events. After receiving complaints from the public the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission investigated. According to the Commission Xiaomi sold a total of 26220 units online not the 28000 claimed. Xiaomi therefore closed the online sales when there were still phones available violating Taiwan’s Fair Trade Act. An additional 1750 phones had been reserved for certain qualified buyers but this information was not included in Xiaomi’s advertising. The Commission concluded that Xiaomi cheated 30 customers of purchases and made “a false untrue and misleading representation with regard to quantity of product when conducting online sales promotion activities.” At its meeting on July 30 2014 the Commission passed a resolution fining Xiaomi NT$600000 (US$20000).Product Patent DeficiencyTelecommunications equipment vendor Telefonaktiebolaget L. M. Ericsson (Ericsson) filed a suit against Xiaomi in the High Court of Delhi in December 2014. Ericsson claimed that Xiaomi had violated Ericsson’s patent for a telecommunications technique. Ericsson tried over three years to initiate negotiations authorizing Xiaomi to use the technique but Xiaomi never responded to the proposal. So Ericsson sued Xiaomi hoping for a complete ban on Xiaomi phones in India. On December 11 2014 the court granted Ericsson an injunction barring Xiaomi from importing and selling phones in India until the dispute could be resolved. The court sent supervisors to Xiaomi’s offices in India to oversee Xiaomi’s compliance with the injunction. The result was that Xiaomi’s single-quarter sales in India dropped dramatically by 46 per cent. Xiaomi appealed the injunction pointing out that some of its phones were made with another company’s chips. The court narrowed the ban prohibiting Xiaomi from importing or selling only phones that contained components related to the dispute with Ericsson. Xiaomi could continue to import and sell phones with Qualcomm chips in India.Since Xiaomi’s first patent application in December 2010 Xiaomi submitted a total of 6773 patent applications. As compared to Ericsson’s and Apple’s patent holdings there was still a long way for Xiaomi to go but research and development required a large research staff and huge financial resources. Moreover the periods of research and patent issuance were relatively long. It was extremely difficult for Xiaomi to surpass the super patent giants. This problem restricted overseas sales of Xiaomi phones for a long time.Unsatisfactory SalesXiaomi’s overseas sales through the Xiaomi website and collaborative e-commerce platforms were constantly unsatisfactory; Xiaomi had to seek help from local operators and dealers. Because India was Xiaomi’s most important overseas market the company pursued agreements with telecom operator Bharti Airtel and smartphone store chain brand The MobileStore Limited which had over 800 offline stores in India. But the effects were still unsatisfactory. Xiaomi consistently refused to publish its total overseas sales numbers but a comparison of two IDC surveys that include Xiaomi’s overseas sales shows that Xiaomi’s overseas shipment in 2015 totalled 5.9 million phones which was only 8.33 per cent of the total Chinese overseas smartphone sales. In the same period Huawei sold 43.7 million phones accounting for 41 per cent of the total Chinese overseas smartphone sales (see Exhibit 3).According to the Wall Street Journal Xiaomi’s market shares in other countries in 2014 were 16 per cent in Singapore 7.6 per cent in Taiwan 6.7 per cent in Hong Kong 4.4 per cent in Malaysia 1.6 per cent in India 0.7 per cent in Indonesia and 0.3 per cent in the Philippines. In India for example Xiaomi only sold three million phones in a year compared to India’s yearly total smartphone sales of 80–100 million. Xiaomi’s market share was very small behind Samsung’s 23 per cent and Micromax’s 17 per cent. Moreover more and more Chinese smartphone brands were entering the Indian market putting tremendous pressure on Xiaomi.Jun Lei’s ConcernsLei’s disappointment was obvious when he finished his speech at the annual meeting. His dream was becoming more and more difficult to pursue. Lei reached out to co-founder Wanqiang Li asking him to return to Xiaomi. In 2011 Li had been responsible for the formation of Xiaomi’s web operations marketing service business logistics and other businesses. But in October 2014 Li had suddenly announced his resignation; he wanted to build new products in Silicon Valley for a period of time. Li suggested to Lei two strategies: (1) Seek offline partners and establish an international strategic alliance. Offline partners could provide more channels to Xiaomi and the partners could share the risk of expanding into overseas markets. (2) Develop MIUI and its peripheral smart hardware allowing Xiaomi to pursue a new market share and reduce patent disputes.Which strategy should Lei choose or was there a better way?Exhibit 1: Financing of Beijing Xiaomi Technology Co.

Adopting unique business practices such as using old aircraft paying labour with hourly wages rather than salaries and unbundling airline fees it grew from just one aircraft in 1998 to 84 aircraft by the end of 2016 targeting primarily 19 tourist destinations and 92 under-served cities (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Furthermore the base fares of Allegiant were not only the lowest in the industry but also half the price of the round-trip fares provided by any other low-cost domestic airline in the United States. In addition Allegiant offered the convenience of nonstop flights to vacation destinations across the United States. Further it created value for leisure travellers by providing complete travel solutions at affordable prices: it partnered directly with hotels and car rentals to provide complete low-cost vacation packages to consumers. Consequently for 53 consecutive quarters until March 31 2016 Allegiant reported no losses. Allegiant also received various awards. In 2010 it was recognized as the best low-cost airline by Aviation Week. Furthermore Forbes named Allegiant one of America’s best small companies for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012. However by 2014 customer complaints were also highest for Allegiant among all budget airlines. In 2015 it was one of the lowest scorers on the customer satisfaction index among all major U.S. airlines (see Exhibit 3). After September 2015 other problems arose with Allegiant such as delayed and cancelled flights several emergency landings labour issues and pilot strikes. Even though Allegiant started taking corrective actions by July 2016—for example raising pay for pilots and buying new aircraft—the company’s fast pace of profitable growth and low customer satisfaction continued to puzzle the entire U.S. airline industry. What was so unique about Allegiant’s strategies that it could offer the lowest possible airfares and also become a profitable airline while competitors were struggling to earn good margins? How did Allegiant remain so profitable despite such poor customer satisfaction scores? Further would it be able to sustain its profitability in the long run?COMPANY BACKGROUNDAllegiant was founded in 1997 by Mitch Allee Jim Patterson and Captain David Beadle. However Maurice J. Gallagher Jr. who was previously associated with ValuJet Airlines (ValuJet) and West Air Co. Ltd. and was also one of the largest creditors and the chief executive officer (CEO) of Allegiant gained control of the airline in December 2000 immediately after Allegiant filed for bankruptcy. Immediately after taking control he looked for low-cost strategies to build Allegiant’s revenue. Gallagher decided to “. . . go where they ain’t” and therefore targeted markets like leisure travellers who were not served by larger commercial carriers. Allegiant therefore launched its services in smaller towns or cities such as Colorado Springs Colorado; Casper Wyoming; and Appleton Wisconsin as these cities did not have the population base to support regular airline service. In March 2002 the airline acquired its first MD-80 aircraft; these aircraft were old used and less fuel-efficient. Allegiant took on new destinations cautiously typically starting with a few flights per week and it did not sign any long-term agreements with airports. When Allegiant had enough travellers in a set timeframe it invested more in that destination; otherwise it left the market easily. By 2004 with this approach of cautious growth Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas its major hub. In 2006 it became a public limited company and was registered as Allegiant Travel Company. This company name signalled Allegiant’s intention to provide not only low-cost air travel but also overall economic vacation deals through partnerships with hotels car rentals and entertainment service providers. While other small airlines were selling their MD-80s to buy Boeing and Airbus aircraft Allegiant maintained its strategy of using old less fuel-efficient (but cheaper) MD-80s. In 2011 to further support its growth to additional cities it purchased 13 MD-80s from Scandinavian Airlines. By 2015 Allegiant had a fleet of 80 aircraft—of which 51 were MD-80s—and was flying to 88 destinations in the United States (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Allegiant’s unique initiatives resulted in high profitability profit margins and earnings per share all of which grew tremendously in 2011–2015 (see Exhibit 4). UNIQUE ELEMENTS OF ALLEGIANT’S STRATEGYFocusing on Untapped Consumer Segments Allegiant Airways did not focus on high-fare-paying business travellers the segment that was the emphasis of traditional commercial and some low-cost airlines. Allegiant was more interested in offering low-cost travel services to passengers who would have their Disney ticket in their back pocket and a sunscreen tube and bikini in their carry-on bag. It thus focused on cost-conscious leisure travellers residing in smaller cities with populations less than 900000 who wanted to fly to vacation destinations such as Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix Orlando or Honolulu (see Exhibit 5). Allegiant connected these travellers who would otherwise not fly to leisure destinations at costs as low as $200 for a round-trip journey. Competitive AdvantageAccording to Andrew Levy former president of Allegiant one advantage at Allegiant was that it was clear about its target passengers: “We’re not trying to be everything to everybody which is what the rest of the industry has always tried to do.” Further elaborating on Allegiant’s strategy Levy noted “We’re not taking share [from other airlines]. We’re stimulating new demand.” Before Allegiant these cost-conscious leisure travellers were not flying at all because traditional airlines considered smaller cities’ airports to be unprofitable.Consequently by June 2014 Allegiant had a monopoly over 90 per cent of the routes it was flying; only 10 per cent of its routes overlapped with other ultra-low-cost carriers and full-service carriers in the U.S. aviation industry. Furthermore its route economics were different from those for ultra-low-cost carriers because the company focused on leisure travel. For example Allegiant flew mainly during weekends and did not require quick turnaround time. Other ultra-low-cost airlines such as Spirit Airlines (Spirit) and Frontier Airlines (Frontier) had to focus on quick turnaround and flight frequency as they targeted both leisure and business travellers. However given that Allegiant primarily catered to smaller cities it had a low market share in the U.S. airline industry (see Exhibit 6).In 2014 when Allegiant explored launching international flights to vacation destinations in Mexico Canada and the Caribbean it clearly indicated that it would grow only to the extent it could manage operations profitably. According to Allegiant the firm could afford slow and manageable growth as it perceived no competition from other airlines given their non-overlapping airline routes.Unique Low-Cost InitiativesFleet and Frequency ManagementTo lower costs Allegiant did not purchase new aircraft. It purchased a fleet of MD-80s which in the airline industry were called the “jalopy of the skies.” These were typically old aircraft that were dumped by commercial airlines due to rising fuel prices. Although MD-80s were less fuel-efficient than other aircraft Allegiant still saw potential for cost saving: old MD-80s were available for $3 million whereas a new aircraft would have cost $1 billion. Further analysis by Allegiant indicated that MD-80s had plenty of reliable life as they were on average used for 34000 cycles whereas the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) permitted up to 60000 cycles. Additionally Allegiant did not offer frequent flight services on a daily basis but rather offered more flights on weekends; it could follow this model because of its emphasis on tourism. Instead of offering three flights per day it served consumers just three days a week. Furthermore flight frequency even depended on the season since tourism was a seasonal business. For example in March 2013 the average aircraft utility was seven hours per day while in September it was four hours per day. Allegiant aircraft also did not require quick turnaround time due to the low frequency of use. With these measures in place even though MD-80s were older and less fuel-efficient aircraft they remained a good fit with Allegiant’s business model. Consequently the company’s return on investment and assets was one of the best in the industry (see Exhibit 6). Allegiant also had other cost-saving measures in place such as using airports in smaller cities. These airports charged lower landing fees and their security was relatively cheaper. For example in 2015 surcharges for the St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport in Florida amounted to $1.60 per passenger whereas it was $5.50 per passenger for the larger Tampa International Airport Florida. In larger cities Allegiant used secondary airports and rather than maintaining permanent kiosks for tickets and other services it rented counters. Human Resource ManagementThe biggest overhead cost in the airline business after fuel costs was labour. To minimize this cost Allegiant relied more on variable pay proportionate to number of hours worked with some minimum basic pay. Furthermore Allegiant avoided the cost of overnight stays by staffing crews for full-day round trips. Consequently by 2015 Allegiant had one of the highest revenue per employee ratios in the industry due to labour productivity initiatives (see Exhibit 6). Allegiant’s low-cost philosophy was also reflected in its organizational culture. Even the CEO Gallagher did not have a private office or special parking space. He worked in the open with other employees. Conference meeting rooms were small. Top executives eschewed luxury cars; they did not wear expensive watches and shoes but opted instead for casual clothing. As one of the executives commented they believed in spending money on things that were important not for show.Frugal In-Flight ServiceAllegiant was also frugal with its in-flight services. Seat reclining options were removed in order to save weight and fuel expenses. Similarly seat pockets were removed to make the task of cleanup easier. Since serving hot beverages consumed more fuel and required maintenance such services were not offered even on a paid basis. It further saved costs by not providing amenities such as Wi-Fi.Revenue StrategyAllegiant did not consider itself an airline company only but rather a provider of complete travel solutions. As former president Levy commented “We do not view our business as [just] the transportation of people from point A to point B.” He further added “We view that as an important part of a broader relationship with our customers.” Since its target consumers were leisure travellers it partnered with several hotels car rental companies and entertainment event sponsors to make these services available at a lower cost. These agreements were essential to its business model: unlike other airlines Allegiant did not consider vacation packages to be secondary services but viewed selling these packages as important as selling air seats. Allegiant did not rely on third parties and had direct contact with more than 400 hotels; the hotel module was built into its reservation system. Allegiant promoted these hotels and third-party services heavily on its website. Revenue from non-fare services was $5.87 per passenger in 2009 and it increased to $41.20 in 2012. In 2014 Allegiant booked 595000 hotel nights and 844000 car rentals across various tourist destinations. Since 2011 earnings from such services represented one-third or more of the company’s total revenues (see Exhibit 4).Allegiant’s strategy also relied on reducing its base airfare. To do this the company unbundled all amenities that a full-service carrier or even a low-cost carrier would offer with charges included in the ticket price such as free carry-on baggage. Apart from the typical low-cost model Allegiant also charged fees on other elements of service. For example if a consumer purchased airline tickets with a credit card a processing fee of $8 was charged. Similarly if tickets were booked through call centres a $15 fee was charged. Even carry-on baggage was not free of cost.Focus on Customer Value CreationIn 2013 in collaboration with the consulting firm Heart+Mind Strategies Allegiant conducted a study to explore important factors consumers considered while availing vacation travel. The majority of the participants indicated that low fares and value for money were the most important factors. Further nine out of 10 travellers were willing to drive a little farther to secondary airports to use ultra-low-cost airlines. They further indicated their desire to give up basic amenities in return for lower base fares.Allegiant believed that it empowered their customers to choose the amenities they wanted and pay accordingly. Thus by lowering base fares and eliminating free amenities Allegiant believed it provided consumers with increased flexibility. Levy mentioned that customers trusted Allegiant for its outstanding value on flights. However as a travel company and not just an airline Allegiant wanted to provide customers with value in all aspects of travel. In 2010 Allegiant therefore updated its logo and debuted a new tag line “Travel is Our Deal” to reflect the exceptional travel deals that it provided. Allegiant promised that it had the lowest prices on air and hotel vacation packages and it further offered customers free round-trip tickets if they found a better deal somewhere else. Apart from low fares Allegiant also provided leisure travellers the convenience of nonstop flights. Thus a passenger could cover the distance between Peoria and Las Vegas in fewer than four hours at a price of $130 instead of the seven hours including layovers provided by other traditional airlines at a price of $320.Focusing on customer service Allegiant offered paperless mobile boarding pass capability to travellers in 2014. Allegiant specifically worked with small to mid-sized airports to introduce the technology. The self-service technology helped Allegiant further lower costs and pass on the benefits to consumers. In September 2016 Allegiant launched a co-branded Bank of America MasterCard. This was again unique because unlike business travellers leisure travellers travelled just once or twice a year. Thus frequent flyer reward points would not have been valuable to them. Those who used the co-branded card for an annual fee of $59 were given three points for spending on Allegiant two points for dining and one for other purchases on the card. One air ticket was made complimentary if the cardholder chose a four-day hotel package or car rental through Allegiant. All these value-adding initiatives resulted in more passengers using Allegiant thereby resulting in a high load factor (see Exhibit 7). Marketing and Promotion In 2010 Allegiant started focusing on social media and improved its website’s appearance. It launched a social media advertisement featuring employees who highlighted Allegiant’s commitment to offering the best travel deals for consumers.As Allegiant was expanding it also decided to improve its media presence dramatically. In August 2013 Allegiant launched its first national television advertising campaign. Since Allegiant was known for its ultra-low fares and exceptional value deals its first advertisement was called “Here Is the Deal with Free Sodas” which educated consumers about Allegiant’s approach to saving money for consumers. The advertisement explained how the free soda offered on other airlines was already included in a passenger’s ticket price but on Allegiant there were no such charges. The advertisement clearly conveyed the message “[Y]ou only pay for and get what you want.” As Allegiant continued its growth it launched a second set of national advertisements in 2015 with the slogan “Listen to Your Wallet.” In this campaign the objective was to differentiate Allegiant from other low-cost carriers and tell consumers that affordable travel was possible with Allegiant. Allegiant simultaneously released ads on social media sites such as YouTube Facebook and Twitter receiving positive comments from fans and followers. Additionally Allegiant’s popularity in small cities soared primarily through word of mouth. Whenever Allegiant added a new route or a new service it aimed to attract free publicity in local newspapers by sending Las Vegas showgirls to pose with airport directors. According to the company such stunts created sufficient buzz among potential travellers.Allegiant also promoted live shows which involved passenger participation and were held on their planes. In 2014 shows like “Game Plane” and “Antiques Roadshow” were shot entirely on their planes with cash prizes and trivia contests to entertain customers. According to Allegiant shooting game shows on the plane was appealing to passengers on board for vacations. In June 2013 Allegiant launched the “Dodge High Fares!” campaign which ran through July and August during the dodge ball season in the United States. The advertisements were broadcast on television radio and social media across 29 cities where dodge ball tournaments were held. As part of this campaign Allegiant also announced free round trips to contest winners. Allegiant realized that a potential set of Allegiant customers were also sports enthusiasts. Consequently in 2016 it partnered with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) and announced that it would be the official passenger airline of NASCAR. Allegiant also reported its sponsorship of NASCAR for the next three years thus enhancing affordability and convenience of air service for NASCAR fans.Allegiant also engaged in community outreach as it expanded its business. In May 2012 Allegiant partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the United States providing $250000 worth of donated travel wish destinations. In addition Allegiant made cash donations of $150000. The relationship with the charity was depicted on its aircraft: newly acquired aircraft were painted with the name of the charity. Allegiant also contributed one dollar from every in-flight snack purchase to the charity. Similarly Allegiant worked with the Boys’ and Girls’ Club of Broward County surprising 100 students with free airfare as a reward for running fitness programs. In 2016 Allegiant launched promotional offers during the summer refunding $140000 worth of fares to randomly selected passengers.ISSUES FACING ALLEGIANTHuman Resource IssuesGradually several difficulties emerged at Allegiant. First it experienced staffing issues. Though Allegiant was a profitable airline pilots felt that they were underpaid. After three years of negotiation pilots decided to strike concerning this issue in 2011; however Allegiant managed to get a court ruling prohibiting them from striking. Nevertheless the issue reflected poorly on Allegiant’s performance and its stock price went down by 16 per cent. In the midst of this chaos many pilots also decided to resign. Between 2011 and 2014 their resignation rate increased by 600 per cent.Customer Service IssuesStaffing issues caused problems on the customer end as well. Customers often complained that flights were delayed and airline employees provided them with little information. As one customer stated “It was pretty apparent most of the staff is very inexperienced and they just don’t really know what they're doing.” Allegiant had on-time performance for only 76 per cent of its flights on its most busy 20 routes in the United States. At times passengers were also told that flights had to be cancelled either because pilots were overworked or because other crew were not available. A consumer watchdog forum commented that Allegiant’s tagline should have been “Travel is our deal but not on time.”Allegiant did offer some customer support by providing hotel accommodation when flights were significantly delayed. However this arrangement was available only to those who were staying farther than 50 miles from the airport of departure. Although consumers found value in flying with Allegiant the long flight delays bothered them. As one consumer noted “I had no problems with Allegiant. . . . Even after purchasing two checked bags I saved over $400 on my flight going back home. However I dislike having to worry about whether my flight will be delayed.” In fact these customer service issues have reflected poorly on Allegiant. Between January 2013 and July 2014 out of 15 carriers that served Cincinnati (one of the major hubs for Allegiant) Allegiant recorded the maximum number of customer complaints per 100000 customers (see Exhibit 8). Apart from being the most profitable airline it was also dubbed the most hated airline. Growth IssuesIn March 2016 Allegiant announced that it was adding three new cities and connecting them to 22 routes. Allegiant had already grown from 195 routes in 2012 to 296 routes in 2015 (see Exhibit 2). Allegiant’s goal was to expand 10–15 per cent each year to maintain pace with operational issues. However critics believed that Allegiant was showing signs of stress due to its uncontrollable growth. They drew parallels between Allegiant and ValuJet an upstart airline in the 1990s that Gallagher current CEO of Allegiant had helped co-found. Like Allegiant it grew quickly and faced similar problems of not having adequate personnel. Along with the decreasing life of Allegiant’s aircraft and its continued expansion Allegiant was also dealing with flight safety issues.Safety IssuesBetween September 2015 and January 2016 Allegiant experienced several emergency landings and delays caused mainly by mechanical issues. The Aviation Mechanics Coalition specifically documented 98 instances of maintenance issues during this five-month period 35 of which were related to engine function failures. What is known as catastrophic engine failure in the aviation industry was also reported twice in this time period. Instances of cabin pressurization and smoke problems were also reported. Pilots believed that Allegiant’s approach to maintenance was not up to industry standards and was dangerous. Allegiant was highly cost-conscious; consequently rather than employ its own maintenance crew it outsourced maintenance to third-party contractors who Allegiant pilots claimed were inexperienced in working on the aging MD-80s. Even Allegiant’s own mechanics mentioned that the culture at the firm was to “just move the metal” and push the aircraft to the next station. THE ROAD AHEADDespite all these issues in an industry where other airlines struggled to at least recover costs Allegiant’s earnings kept soaring (see Exhibit 4). By March 31 2016 it had reported profits for 53 consecutive quarters. In 2015 Allegiant’s profit increased by 154 per cent reaching a value of $220.4 million. Overall its profit margin was 15 per cent higher than that of traditional airlines. Allegiant’s profit sustainability index was found to be 8.8 mainly owing to labour productivity. In mid-2016 Allegiant was in the process of hiring new pilots raising their salaries and buying new aircraft. Nevertheless Spirit among others was competing closely with Allegiant by offering low base fares and flying some overlapping routes. For example in 2016 Spirit added to its portfolio new routes over which Allegiant previously had a monopoly such as routes from Akron Ohio to Fort Lauderdale Florida and from Akron Ohio to Myrtle Beach South Carolina. Expansion by another ultra-low-cost airline Frontier also resulted in route overlap with Allegiant such as from Cincinnati Ohio to Tampa Florida. Furthermore compared to Allegiant both Frontier and Spirit had more frequent flights on their overlapping routes.Allegiant might have had a cost advantage due to lower fuel prices (see Exhibit 9); however with rising wage and aircraft costs due to salary hikes and new aircraft purchases poor customer satisfaction scores and increasing competition how long would Allegiant be able to maintain its profitability?Exhibit 1: Total In-Service Aircraft and Average AgeSource: Developed by the authors based on information in Allegiant Travel Company Annual Report 2015 May 2016 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 2: Leisure Destinations and Cities ServedSource: Developed by the authors based on information in Allegiant Travel Company Annual Report 2015 May 2016 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant Company 2014 Annual Report May 2015 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant  Travel Company 2013 Annual Report May 2014 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 3: Customer Satisfaction IndexSource: Developed by the authors based on information in Kathryn Vasel “Spirit Airlines Scores Dead Last in Customer Satisfaction” CNN Money April 26 2016 accessed August 24 2016 http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/26/pf/best-and-worst-airlines-customer-satisfaction/; “Benchmark by Industry: Airlines” American Customer Satisfaction Index accessed September 29 2016 http://theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=147&catid=&Itemid=212&i=Airlines.Exhibit 4: Financial Data (as of December 31 2015) Note: All data in $000s except for Total Ancillary Revenue as Percentage of Total Revenue Earnings Per Share and Operating Margin.Source: Developed by the authors based on information in Allegiant Travel Company Annual Report 2015 May 2016 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant Travel Company 2014 Annual Report May 2015 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant Travel Company 2013 Annual Report May 2014 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 5: Catchment Area of AllegiantSource: Developed by the authors based on information in “Allegiant: A Successful Niche Player with Wider Lessons for the World’s Airline Industry” CAPA: Centre for Aviation April 14 2014 accessed September 26 2016 http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/allegiant-a-successful-niche-player-with-wider-lessons-for-the-worlds-airline-industry-162353.Exhibit 6: Financial comparison with competitors (as of September 30 2016)Note: ROA = return on assets; ROI = return on investment.Source: Developed by the authors based on information in “Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT)” Yahoo!

The explosion that followed killed 47 people and destroyed half of the municipality’s downtown. At least 30 buildings were lost including the local library. More than 100 businesses were shuttered or displaced. At the time Canadian city planners and railway managers had just been given recommendations crafted by the Proximity Initiative a collaborative effort between the Railway Association of Canada (RAC) and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) intended to tackle so-called proximity-to-rail issues. These Guidelines for New Development in Proximity to Railway Operations (“Proximity to Rail”) included a call to further push development back from train tracks by setting new setback standards for building on private and public property in proximity-to-rail operations.Thanks to urban growth and railway expansion the need to better address the conflicting interests that existed between population centres and railway operations—ranging from noise and vibrations to blocked roads and public safety—had been on the rise for decades. The Lac-Mégantic tragedy galvanized this need. In early 2015 Montreal made headlines by becoming the first major Canadian city to adopt the Proximity Initiative’s guidelines. Around the same time Calgary City Manager Jeff Fielding sat in his office contemplating staff recommendations that essentially favoured following Montreal’s lead. Calgary and the province of Alberta had recently been affected by several disasters including a historic flood in the city and throughout southern Alberta in 2013 and a significant wildfire in northern Alberta in 2011. The City of Calgary was lauded for its response coordination and recovery activities in these disasters. Years of intentional investment in comprehensive emergency management—preparedness mitigation response and recovery—had proven indispensable as these disasters hit the city and province. These disaster preparedness practices ensured comprehensive land use planning decisions that included life safety considerations such as first response access economic diversification resulting from a wide economic base and the pursuit of a vital and sustainable community. Looking out at the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) line that ran through the downtown core of his city a community built on the historic contributions of rail oil and agriculture Fielding understood the controversy that would be generated by imposing the Proximity to Rail guidelines in his municipality. There had to be a better approach more suited to Calgary’s specific context.Calgary’s Centre City or downtown was the business and cultural heart of the city. The Municipal Development Plan identified a goal to accommodate 232000 jobs and 70000 people in the downtown within the next 60 years. Founded on the principles of sustainable development and guided by a philosophy of fiscal responsibility and managed growth these densification goals required city planners to provide “leadership on growth and change within a strategic framework that achieves the best possible social environmental and economic outcomes while operating within the City’s financial capacity.” This was to be sought through purposeful and dense residential and commercial development. Fielding was interested in building stronger relationships with the community to attract development and retain investment in the City. Implementing the Proximity Initiative’s guidelines while intended to limit potential safety risks in the case of a derailment or volume release would simultaneously limit urban development opportunities particularly within the downtown. The guidelines were not standards required by law nor were the guidelines developed with significant and relevant contribution by the City of Calgary. The guidelines did not consider balancing public safety with the economic diversification specific to Calgary’s context. Fielding concluded “We would have to think harder about a solution for Calgary.”RISK ASSESSMENTThe Proximity Initiative was created to help RAC and FCM members address conflicting interests including the transport of dangerous goods via rail through population centres. The Proximity to Rail guidelines were created to help municipal and provincial governments mitigate the effects of having new development in proximity-to-railway operations. The report strongly recommended municipalities take a proactive approach to identifying and planning for potential conflicts between rail operations and new development in proximity-to-rail corridors. The report emphasized the urbanization of cities the interest of municipalities to curb urban sprawl the demand for new forms of residential properties and the conversion of commercial and industrial properties in proximity-to-rail locations to residential uses. The guidelines were specifically not intended to be applied to locations where proximity issues already existed as these had to be addressed on a site-specific basis. The tabled guidelines however required no significant adjustment to railway operations while asking municipalities to accept the potential loss of development options along rail corridors. And while the proposed setbacks could limit the damage of a common derailment or volume release the guidelines would not appreciably limit the risk of catastrophic rail accidents. Risk in a municipal context was generally assessed on its likelihood or probability—how realistic it was for risk to occur in relation to other contributing factors—and according to its impact—what the effects of the risk would be on life safety property the environment and the economy. The probability of a catastrophic rail event was low relative to other major events and catastrophes that Calgary could face. However the impact of a train derailment or volume loss on life safety property protection and environmental preservation was understood to be potentially significant. A derailment was not out of the range of possibilities—for example during the 2013 flood event a rail car derailment occurred that could have resulted in a threat to life safety and brought about severe environmental consequences. However the City of Calgary and external partners including the rail industry had trained and exercised for exactly such an event and they were able to mitigate the impact of the derailment during an exceptionally trying time—in the midst of a disastrous flood event. Meanwhile the effects of imposing the Proximity to Rail guidelines within the city’s downtown core presented a real threat to economic and environment vitality.Fielding was certain that following the guidelines would limit development opportunities particularly within the downtown core while doing little to lower the risk of train derailment or reduce the amount of hazardous materials travelling through Calgary. He believed that to address proximity in what he considered a responsible manner Calgary needed a different approach. The approach had to recognize the value of the rail industry to Calgary and influence the RAC to bear a share of the responsibility associated with conducting its operations in a heavily populated area. Additionally the approach should refrain from creating additional development industry pressures not grounded in defensible risk reduction and should avoid losing the confidence and trust of the city’s planning and emergency response staff who had worked hard on preparing recommendations that aligned with the guidelines suggested by the FCM. Importantly Fielding was not willing to sacrifice public safety to support real estate values and land development opportunities. “As city manager and a member of the Canadian Institute of Planners” Fielding said “I am responsible for upholding professional standards.”CALGARY’S STEEL SPINECalgary lands were originally inhabited more than 8000 years ago by the First Nations people and were called Moh’kinsstis the traditional territory of the Blackfoot people. Calgary owed its name to Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers who saw the local landscape and rivers as an ideal location to build a fort. Known as “The Elbow” or “Bow River Fort” the police detachment was later briefly dubbed “Brisebois” by Inspector A.E. Brisebois. This did not impress Colonel James Macleod who preferred Calgary the name of his home in the Scottish Highlands. However although the fort gave Calgary its name it did not spawn the city. Calgary had become what it was now because of its steel spine. In 1883 the arrival of the CP railway facilitated travel across Alberta which led waves of pioneer ranchers from across the world to settle near the fort. With a population of 4000 Calgary was officially proclaimed a city in 1884. Ever since the railway had played a major role in local development.At one point CP owned most of Calgary’s downtown where the signature street was named after the company’s first president Lord Mount Stephen. The Calgary Tower was funded by a CP subsidiary in 1968. The community of Mount Royal was built to house CP executives. The city’s grid and streetcar routes were designed to transport rail workers to the company’s Ogden Yard which opened in 1912 when CP was the largest employer in Calgary. As the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) put it in a special report on the city’s development “The CPR has shaped Calgary’s evolution more than any other corporation over the past 100 years. Some might even say Calgary’s entrepreneurial spirit is a legacy from the CP’s pioneer vision of building a transcontinental railway more than 100 years ago.” With its head office in Calgary CP remained a major employer and taxpayer in the city of 1.3 million. There were 158 kilometres of rail lines in Calgary of which 7 per cent ran through the downtown core all at grade level.Thanks to urban expansion the relationship between Calgary and its steel spine had never been closer. In 2004 a team of city planners and community members offered a variety of competing ideas to transform the city’s “Midtown” district most of which involved moving rail operations. According to media reports the cost of these ideas proved prohibitive partly because “CP’s position was [that] somebody else would have to pay for all the relocation cost and they would still retain ownership of the land.” This focused ideas on redeveloping land near existing tracks. As the CBC noted in a special report on the City’s changing relationship with rail operations downtown land in close proximity to rail that was once mostly surface parking lots had in recent years “become construction sites for major new offices hotels condos and museums.” The National Music Centre for example was built on a formerly barren surface parking lot across from rail tracks. Even CP had redeveloped property in close proximity-to-rail operations transforming Ogden Yard into a head office campus.Simply put Calgary’s long-range planning goals had long been entwined with the CP operations that literally run through the heart of the city. These operations created the potential for more adverse effects for Calgary from any implementation of the new proximity guidelines than for its municipal peers. The period of economic success that preceded the oil market crash saw Calgary experiencing long-awaited development interest and permit submissions within the Centre City including some properties along the rail lines. With the economic downturn however these permits were at risk of being withdrawn. As a result railway setback guidelines had to be considered in the context of the additional development pressures they represented for Calgary during changing economic conditions. DERAILED COLLABORATIONIn 2003 the FCM and the RAC signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a solution that could be commonly applied in a fair way “to mitigate the impacts of locating new development in proximity-to-railway operations.” The FCM–RAC Proximity Initiative Steering Committee was established in 2004 with an equal number of FCM officials and senior RAC railway representatives as well as members of the Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators and observers from Transport Canada and the Canadian Transportation Agency. In 2013 after almost a decade of collaboration on the issue new guidelines were released to assist municipal governments and railways in reviewing and determining general planning policies and provisions for the conversion of land in proximity-to-rail operations.The stated objective was to ensure quality of life by mitigating railway-oriented effects such as noise vibrations and safety hazards. The tabled guidelines included six primary recommendations (see Exhibit 1) primarily intended for new residential development. The most contentious for Calgary was the call to establish the following new setback standards for building on private and public property in proximity-to-rail operations. Freight Rail Yard: 300 metresPrincipal Main Line: 30 metresSecondary Main Line: 30 metresPrincipal Branch Line: 15 metresSecondary Branch Line: 15 metresSpur Line: 15 metresMeasured from railway property lines instead of tracks these recommended setbacks would obviously allow railway managers to breathe easier by providing an additional buffer zone on municipal land expanding the distance between communities and rail corridors and freight yards permitting the dissipation of rail-oriented emissions vibrations and noise. They further served railways by pushing urban development back potentially limiting disaster-related costs and damages. But while setbacks served the interest of railways they wiped out development opportunities near rail operations while doing nothing to prevent rail incidents or events. “The proposed common guidelines” Fielding noted “mitigate impact not risk. They don’t reduce the chances of having derailments or explosions in my city caused by operator error travelling speeds failure of rail or track infrastructure or dangerous cargo.” While tasked with finding workable solutions that were fair to both urban development and railway operations the Proximity Initiative collaboration effort was challenged from the start by different needs conflicting agendas and uneven levels of influence.  Originally formed as The Canadian Railway War Board in 1917 to coordinate rail activities and ensure the efficient movement of troops and supplies during the First World War the RAC represented more than 50 freight and passenger railway companies that moved 75 million people and CA$250 billion worth of goods in Canada annually. Until 2000 the organization—formally incorporated in 1953—had dealt primarily with member services and operational issues at the national level as well as the coordination of standards on a continental basis. At the start of the new millennium however RAC received a new mandate which included public policy advocacy on behalf of its members who had a common interest in limiting regulations and cost increases related to proximity issues. The well-funded RAC railway industry organization was formed to protect the bottom line of its membership by opposing the “frenzied lobbying or exaggerated anecdotal complaints from interest groups” when fighting an earlier version of Bill C-52 An Act to Amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act. On the other side of the Proximity Initiative table was the FCM which counted about 2000 local governments across Canada as members representing 91 per cent of the Canadian population. Varying in size location and economic health each of these municipalities had unique challenges and interests especially when it came to proximity-to-rail issues. In a submission outlining its guidelines to the Canada Transportation Act Review the FCM–RAC Proximity Initiative argued its model of collaboration “demonstrates that municipalities railways and government can work together to improve rail safety.” At the time the proposed guidelines were widely supported by railways but had been adopted only by the cities of Windsor London Ottawa and Montreal. The federal government was therefore urged to work with provincial governments which held land planning jurisdiction to help advance common land use planning practices and avoid a city-by-city approach to proximity issues. In other words the people behind the new guidelines wanted to ensure rail interests were not affected by any municipality that considered the new guidelines a harder pill to swallow.MIXING SEMINAL MOMENTS WITH PUBLIC POLICY MAKINGThe magnitude of the Lac-Mégantic disaster—which was alleged to have been the result of a criminal failure to apply backup hand brakes on a train carrying dangerous materials and that was left unlocked and unattended on a main rail line up a hill next to a residential area—highlighted the need to ensure that railways did not unreasonably threaten public safety. In addition to killing dozens of people and causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage the oil train explosion—which could be seen from space—led to the evacuation of about 2000 people roughly a third of Lac-Mégantic’s population. Local land and waterways were contaminated. Family members of missing people were forced to provide DNA from belongings such as toothbrushes to help identify burned bodies at least in the cases where remains recovery was considered possible. As one disaster worker noted few people were wounded in the fire because “They’re all dead.”Following the incident the transport of dangerous cargo by rail became a political hot potato particularly in Canada where pipeline capacity did not meet the needs of an energy sector that served as an important economic pillar. This was amplified by increased media coverage of rail incidents and disasters and of political campaigning for the next federal election. On July 23 2013 Transport Canada issued an emergency directive that among other things required at least two people to operate trains carrying dangerous materials and prohibited the practice of leaving trains with dangerous materials parked unattended on main lines. In April 2014 the Canadian government ordered a phase-out or retrofit of older DOT-111 oil-by-rail cars.On February 20 2015 the federal government introduced the Safe and Accountable Rail Act. Amending the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act Bill C-52 strengthened the liability and compensation regime for federally regulated railway companies. It primarily aimed to establish minimum insurance levels for freight railway operations; to establish that a railway company “is liable without proof of fault or negligence for damages resulting from an accident involving crude oil; [to] increase the industry liability insurance coverage; and [to] establish a fund financed by levies on shippers to cover the damages resulting from a railway accident involving crude oil that exceed liability insurance coverage.”Bill C-52 was widely seen as sensible because Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway filed for protection from creditors following the Lac-Mégantic incident leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs and legal claims unpaid. The company’s insurance policy had a per-occurrence limit of just $25 million. But in March 2015 demand for regulatory action intensified after four North American oil-train events occurred in a matter of weeks. Noting the trains in question were travelling at moderate speeds and hauling CPC-1232 tanker cars which were supposed to be safer than the rail cars involved in Lac-Mégantic critics insisted much more needed to be done. As the CBC noted For some this raises questions about rail safety train speeds and length tanker-car standards and stabilizing the oil within the tankers. For others it means we should be talking about pipelines again. “Slowing down is one option” said Ian Naish a former director of rail and pipeline investigations at the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. “Shorter trains might be another option but that will cost money. And then dare I say it another option is pipelines or some other mode of transportation.”When it comes to pipelines versus rail it’s not comparing apples to apples. When a pipeline leaks more product is spilled but it’s not likely to explode. When an oil car derails there is a higher chance of loss of life or destruction of property but the spill is relatively contained. It really depends on what you’re worried about—cost CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions safety or the environment? “This is a discussion we absolutely need to have” said Michal Moore director of energy and environmental policy at the University of Calgary. “It needs to start with safety but also needs to consider what transfers and stores the highest volume of [oil] material at the lowest possible cost.”In April 2015 Federal Transport Minister Lisa Raitt announced a 64-kilometre-per-hour speed limit on trains carrying dangerous goods through urban areas with a population of 100000. She also called for increased inspections of key routes used for transporting dangerous goods. At the time the Canadian National Railway (CN) and CP had already imposed a 56-kilometre-per-hour speed limit which was still twice the speed some critics considered safe.In July 2015 as ongoing cleanup operations in Lac-Mégantic were temporarily halted and church bells rang 47 times to mark the disaster’s anniversary federal opposition leaders attacked the ruling Conservative Party for failing to ensure Canadian communities were protected from rail operations. Claiming the Harper government was not doing enough then Liberal leader Justin Trudeau told the nation “Every possible precaution must be taken to ensure such an incident is never repeated.” Meanwhile Tom Mulcair leader at the time of the New Democrat Party (NDP) promised that an NDP government “would build a railway bypassing Lac-Mégantic which has already paid a high price in human lives.” Raitt defended the government. “Safety is Transport Canada’s top priority” she insisted. “And in the wake of the accident we took immediate concrete action to further protect Canadians and maintain the safety and integrity of the Canadian rail system.” In the aftermath of Lac-Mégantic politicians and industry leaders were pressured to do something—or appear to do something—to make the public safer. In this charged environment many lost sight of the fact that the new proximity guidelines would cost some municipalities a great deal while failing to address any of the issues that critics insisted needed to be addressed to reduce the risk of rail car derailments and/or explosions. These issues included train speeds train lengths car standards infrastructure maintenance and volatile cargo. The relatively low risk of a catastrophic accident posed to Canadian communities by well-managed railway operations was also lost in the heated public discussion. According to a government report on rail safety while the transport of regulated dangerous goods by CN and CP had increased by almost 60 per cent between 1997 and 2006 (in terms of thousands of freight cars moved and millions of revenue ton miles) reportable incidents involving regulated dangerous goods declined considerably. Furthermore while Canada had experienced rail disasters more deadly than the 2013 incident which put the spotlight on proximity issues Lac-Mégantic had been the worst since Confederation. The deadliest rail incident in Canadian history occurred in 1864 when a Grand Trunk train with more than 350 passengers flew off a raised bridge and plunged into the Rivière Richelieu near Mont-St-Hilaire Quebec killing an estimated 99 people. With 48000 kilometres of track Canada had one of the largest rail networks in the world. Nevertheless in the five-year period from 2010 to 2015 the nation experienced 20 train derailments significant enough to be reported in the media (see Exhibit 2). Fewer than 100 people were injured as a result of these incidents and 51 people killed including the 47 fatalities in Lac-Mégantic. Meanwhile the number of Canadian motor vehicle fatalities in 2013 alone was 1951 while the number of serious injuries caused by automobile mishaps topped 10000. In the 2010 to 2014 period there were more than 8000 Canadian fatalities and more than 45000 serious injuries due to automobile-related incidents. “Calgary” Fielding noted “probably faces more risk from tanker trucks on city streets than rail explosions.” Hazard identification and risk analysis had long been undertaken at the City of Calgary including the development of a principal corporate risk summary that included the analysis of natural human-caused economic social and environmental risks. An annual risk assessment was conducted by the director of Emergency Management and was integrated into this corporate risk summary. The City administration understood the importance of analyzing and preparing for the likelihood and impact of a derailment or mass volume release along the rail lines. The steps the City had been taking to mitigate rail risk included derailment exercises and training by emergency response personnel and emergency management partners land use policy collaborative planning and permit review and ongoing relationship development with the rail industry. Furthermore a quarter century ago as a condition of subdivision application approval the City of Calgary implemented a minimum 27.5-metre distance setback from the boundary of the railway right-of-way to the closest part of any habitable building in residential areas. This was with the intent of reducing proximity-to-rail risks.  In the midst of other cities adopting the guidelines and Calgary determining what to do with them two specific commercial and residential applications for development immediately adjacent to the rail lines were submitted to the City. As part of their applications the developers had been asked by the City to provide a risk assessment. Each developer used a separate methodology resulting in different risk results. From this and contextualized with the interests and objectives of the Municipal Development Plan it became evident there was a need for a consistent methodology and base line understanding of the risk probability and impact to life safety property protection and environmental preservation. In 2015 Progressive Conservative MPP (member of provincial parliament) Lisa Thompson whose Ontario riding included Walkerton held a press conference to warn policy makers about the tendency of tragic events to lead to solution-making for the sake of solution-making. Noting that the Walkerton tragedy had led to waves of costly regulations all designed to somehow ensure that an incident caused by neglecting to adhere to existing rules never happened again Thompson called on all politicians to look closely at the “ridiculousness of regulations” that followed Walkerton.Though not minimizing the primary importance of life safety for both response personnel and the public Fielding felt the same way about the new proximity guidelines based on the probability of a derailment or disaster and the management of that specific risk.  CHALLENGING CONVENTIONAL PRACTICEAs an experienced city manager Fielding was aware of rail safety issues when contemplating the dilemma he faced by raising his concerns over the new proximity-to-rail guidelines and challenging his staff to be comprehensive about defining and managing the risk. Prior to becoming the city manager for Calgary he had been the city manager for Burlington Ontario where three VIA Rail Canada employees were killed and dozens of passengers hospitalized after a train came off its tracks in 2012. Less than three months after the Lac-Mégantic incident several rail cars full of flammable liquids derailed in Calgary as a slow-moving train left CP’s Alyth Yard located just five kilometres east of the downtown core. But the new proximity guidelines had been issued months before Lac-Mégantic generated increased demand for regulatory actions to improve public safety. And Fielding could not help but notice that implementing them would not limit the risk of death and destruction caused by similar disasters. A 30-metre setback for example did not reduce the destruction caused when a “tsunami of fire” sparked by human negligence rolled through a populated area. That had been the situation in Lac-Mégantic where waves of spilled oil sparked a fire three times the height of downtown buildings generating heat two kilometres away. In some cases people were forced to jump from the upper floors of downtown buildings to escape the sea of fire that rolled into buildings and storm sewers and re-emerged as towering flames from chimneys and street manholes. The problem of course was that others did not see things the same way as Calgary’s city manager owing in part to the magnitude of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy. “I needed people to look at the probability and impact of the risk materializing—to consider many options that may not have been part of conventional thinking” Fielding noted. The City’s administration continued to work collaboratively with external stakeholders to find solutions to the fundamental issue: How would The City of Calgary support the continued development and economic value of lands in proximity to rail while protecting public safety and buildings? Fielding continued to put this in context with maintaining relationships to support a diversified economy accommodating growth within the major urban centre and retaining Calgary’s vision of being a “great place to make a living a great place to make a life.”EXHIBIT 1: PROXIMITY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONSPolicy Recommendation 1: Municipalities should establish minimum setback requirements through a zoning bylaw amendment.Policy Recommendation 2: Municipalities should consider amending their Official Plan or other appropriate legislation to require noise impact studies as part of any re-zoning or Official Plan amendment near railway operations.Policy Recommendation 3: Urban Design Guidelines for development near railway corridors would be a valuable tool in suggesting building layout and design. Alternatively municipal planners should pay close attention to these issues through a site planning process. Jurisdictions that do not allow comprehensive site planning may wish to consider amendments to their land use planning legislation. Comprehensive zoning for podiums would be a valuable tool for areas in proximity to railway operations that municipalities have identified for redevelopment. Urban Design Guidelines can also speak to appropriate built form including podium design setbacks step backs etc. At minimum municipal planners should secure podium massing as part of a site-specific zoning bylaw amendment. Balconies can be regulated through zoning if administered comprehensively and can be secured as part of a site-specific zoning bylaw. Urban Design Guidelines should also speak to appropriate balcony design (e.g. recessed versus protruding balconies). Urban Design Guidelines should contain comprehensive information on best practices for landscape design and appropriate types and species of plants. Urban Design Guidelines can speak to materiality. Some jurisdictions such as Ontario allow municipalities to regulate external materials through the site plan process. This practice should be encouraged and jurisdictions that do not currently allow for this should consider making appropriate amendments to their land use planning legislation. Policy Recommendation 4: Municipalities should consider amendments to their Official Plan where necessary to make vibration studies a requirement for any zoning bylaw amendment and Official Plan amendment applications.Policy Recommendation 5: Urban Design Guidelines may be useful tools for establishing specifications for the proper use and design of berms. Policy Recommendation 6: Trespass issues can be avoided through careful land use planning. Land uses on each side of a railway corridor or yard should be evaluated with a view to minimizing potential trespass problems. For example schools commercial uses parks or plazas should not be located in proximity to railway facilities without the provision of adequate pedestrian crossings.Source: The Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the Railway Association of Canada Guidelines for New Development in Proximity to Railway Operations May 2013 accessed December 20 2017 http://proximityissue.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2013_05_29_Guidelines_NewDevelopment_E.pdf.

The student was also given a list of eight of the country’s main industries. As an exercise the student was then asked to identify which company operated within which industry. The exercise would test the student’s understanding of how a company’s financial data can be specific to a particular industry. Using only financial figures could the student identify within which industry each company operated? Company and Industry CharacteristicsThe student knew that companies could be categorized in many different ways: financial non-financial manufacturing service and others. Financial characteristics of companies could vary widely for various reasons. However the most important differentiation for a company’s financial data was usually due to the industry within which it operated and the strategies the company adopted.Each industry also had its own characteristics some of which were obvious and could be easily identified. For example a pharmaceutical firm would normally have much higher research and development costs than a consulting firm. Other characteristics could be identified based on industry experience. For example companies in some industries carried high inventory whereas companies in other industries had essentially no inventory. Therefore it was feasible that a company could be identified through its financial statements or ratio analysis. The Eight CompaniesFor the exercise the student was provided with the balance sheets of all eight companies labelled only as A to H (see Exhibit 1). Because each company was listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange its financial data was publicly available. The data was also taken from the income statements of each company and provided in a standardized format (see Exhibit 2). In addition 13 relevant financial ratios were also provided to the student which would be helpful information for the exercise (see Exhibit 3).Companies that operated within the same industry could sometimes differ from each other based on their location structure or strategies. However the eight companies in the student’s assignment were considered typical companies that reflected their respective industry. Each company could therefore be seen as an example of that industry’s norm. The Eight IndustriesThe eight companies operated within eight different industry sectors in Pakistan. A brief description of each company and its industry was provided to help the student understand the characteristics of that particular industry:Commercial bank—Despite being a bank this company represented the most comparable financial statements and ratio categories of a non-financial company. It was one of Pakistan’s largest banks for Internet banking remittances MCB (or Master Cell Bank) mobile retail banking and bank accounts. The company was established in 1947 the same year that Pakistan was established. Its customer base exceeded seven million with over 1400 branches in Pakistan and abroad.Luxury hotel chain—This company managed six luxury hotels in major cities with a total of 1445 rooms and provided international standards in luxury hotel accommodation across South Asia.Hospital—This medical care centre was formed by a team of expatriate health care professionals in 1985. Its 550-bed quaternary health care facility offered international standards in major surgery to local and global patients.Food and beverage company—As a leading provider of quality foods and beverages in Pakistan with four major production facilities this company aimed to enhance quality of life for its customers and to contribute to a healthier future for the country.Oil and gas exploration service company—This company started as a pioneer of the natural gas industry and became a leader in the energy sector in the 1950s contributing 16 discoveries in exploration in just the previous five years. The company negotiates with owners of onshore and offshore acreage that is believed to contain oil and gas and secures leases and permission to drill.Textile composite exporter—This leading exporter of textile products had a composite unit that made everything from cotton to finished goods. It also had 40 retail stores across the country.Pharmaceutical firm—This science-led global health care company conducted research to develop and manufacture innovative pharmaceutical medicines vaccines and consumer health care products.Fertilizer company—As one of the biggest fertilizer companies operating in Pakistan since the 1950s the primary segments of this company included fertilizers crop science and agricultural services that covered a complete range of agriculture products to empower farmers. The company mainly sold its products through distributors.The student had all the information necessary for the exercise. The next step was to begin the process of analyzing the financial data provided for companies A to H (see Exhibits 1 to 3) and matching each one with the eight industries described above.

9B18M128,By Product IVEY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT © NOTE 1: UNDERSTANDING THE CASE METHODA case or case study is a real business story that requires you to step into the role of a manager or a member of the management team that faces a dilemma or the role of a consultant assisting an organization that faces a dilemma. Acting in that role you are tasked with resolving the issues or problems that the profiled organization is facing at a particular moment in time. Alternatively you are asked to evaluate and choose among opportunities that exist for the organization at a specific point in time. Those issues and opportunities may be confined to a specific discipline in business such as accounting marketing human resources or strategic management. However the challenges often involve several disciplines reflecting the multi-faceted nature of business in practice.The case method involves learning by doing. It provides you with an opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills to real-life and realistic situations. Listening to class lectures reading about various business subjects and performing quantitative and qualitative analyses to solve well-defined problems are all valuable learning tools; however management skills and knowledge cannot be developed by these methods alone. Management requires more than applying a storehouse of prepackaged solutions or standard answers. Each situation faced by management has its own variables unique to the situation. Using the case method provides you with valuable opportunities to develop and practise skills you will need in those situations.INTRODUCTION TO UNDERSTANDING THE CASE METHODThis note introduces you to the case method. It provides an overview of the steps used in case analysis and the types of case assignments you might encounter. It is designed to help you develop a basic understanding of the case method and to guide you in approaching your first few cases. Subsequent notes provide more detailed guidance about individual steps in the process.purpose of the case methodCase analysis is used as a teaching and learning tool to practise the art and science of management. The situations described in cases are less structured than the typical problems and questions found in most textbooks. There is not necessarily one right answer to resolving the issues problems or opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) faced by the organization in the case. While some answers could be better than others there is no answer key at the back of the book to tell you whether you have made the right choices.The organization described in the case might be familiar to you and you might even be able to find out what the organization actually did in the situation described in the case; however the approach taken by the organization is not necessarily the one you should recommend. Also because cases describe relatively current or recent situations enough time might not have passed since the decision point in the case to allow you—or others in the business world—to evaluate whether the organization made the best possible choices. You are asked to draw your own conclusions and support them with your own analysis.Learning with the case method will help you develop essential management competencies skills and abilities. You will use technical analytical problem-solving and creative skills. You will hone your written and oral communication skills by writing reports participating in class discussions and making presentations. You will develop your ability to work effectively with others by preparing team case reports and presentations.Along the way you will learn about a wide variety of industries organizations and management issues.reading a caseBefore reading the case itself read the course requirements in the syllabus or on the course website. In addition to understanding the general purpose of the case method it helps to know what your instructor wants you to do with the case—prepare for a class answer questions perform a complete analysis prepare a written report or presentation or undertake some combination of those tasks.When you read the case for the first time resist the temptation to highlight important facts and to begin doing analysis and generating alternative solutions. If you use a highlighter on the first read you will soon find yourself highlighting most of the case especially in a short case that is rich in details. Instead during the initial read establish who the decision maker is and what decision needs to be made. Highlight any questions raised by the principal actors or characters: they usually indicate what work is expected (e.g. answers to specific questions specific types of analysis or evaluation of specific alternatives). Identify key goals of the organization industry key success factors (if they are made explicit) and important constraints (e.g. the urgency of a decision or the lack of resources or expertise). Develop a preliminary understanding of the issues facing the decision maker.Then read the case more carefully a second time. Armed with an initial understanding of the issues you are now prepared to assess the relevance and importance of specific case facts. Highlighting the case facts at this stage will help you to be able to quickly extract them and use them effectively in your analysis. During your second read of the case you can also gain a better understanding of the issues and begin to consider what analysis to perform with the case facts you have identified as relevant and important.Subsequent reads of the case will likely be confined to rereading specific sections of the case as you undertake the analysis described briefly in Section 3 and described in more detail in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054.analyzing a caseOver the course of your business studies you will face a variety of cases. Most of the cases will be in written format but cases can also be provided as videos. The length of cases will vary as will the breadth and complexity of issues they cover. As well some cases will direct and limit the scope of your analysis while other cases will pose general questions that require a more skilled approach to case analysis.Regardless of the size and scope of the case case analysis involves four basic steps:Identify the issues problems and opportunities.Analyze the issues problems and opportunities.Develop and evaluate alternative solutions.Make recommendations for action.Especially for complex cases a case analysis is usually an iterative process. While an essential first step is to identify the issues to be resolved analysis of those issues can refine the issues that were initially identified leading to a revised issue statement.scope of the case guide seriesThis note and others in the Case Guide Series are designed to provide an overview of the case method. They provide a general template or pattern for case analysis that you can apply in various courses throughout your business studies. There is no one right way to analyze a case just as there is no one right answer or solution to the issues presented in a case. You will encounter a variety of situations issues tasks and topics that all require you to use judgment in applying the guidelines provided in the Case Guide Series.The Case Guide Series covers five separate tasks that can form part of your case assignments.Case analysis: For all case assignments you will be required to analyze the case by performing one or more of the steps described in Section 3 (i.e. identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternatives and recommend a course of action). Analyze in the broad sense refers to the full process of applying the case method. Analyze can also specifically refer to the case analysis step of probing into and dissecting issues. In both contexts analysis is a critical component of the case method so it is discussed first and receives the most attention. (See Note 2—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054 and Note 7—“Common Tools for Case Analysis” No. 9B18M059.)Class discussion: In some courses instructors will use discussion of the case to apply and supplement the lecture material; in other courses instructors will use discussion of the case as the main pedagogical tool. To benefit from the discussion and to provide meaningful input it is important to adequately prepare. (See Note 3—“Preparing to Discuss a Case” No. 9B18M055.)Report writing: You could be asked to prepare a written case report—either individually or as part of a small team. For this task the emphasis is on organizing your analysis and findings in a written report that effectively communicates those findings to the reader. In most instances you will be asked to play a specific role (e.g. the internal manager who is the decision maker in the case or an external consultant to that decision maker) and to write a report to a specific reader or group of readers (e.g. the vice-president of marketing or the board of directors). (See Note 4—“Preparing a Written Case Report” No. 9B18M056.)Oral presentation: You could be asked to present your analysis and findings to the class either individually or as part of a small team. The goal in this exercise is to develop and deliver a concise presentation that captures the main thrusts of your analysis and presents them in a professional and engaging manner. Here too you will usually be asked to play a specific role and to present to a specific target audience. (See Note 5—“Making an Oral Case Presentation” No. 9B18M057.)Case exam: Your instructor might use the case method as a testing or examination tool. The goal in this situation is to showcase your analytical and writing skills under the time pressure of an exam setting. It will be important to read the case intentionally so that you can isolate relevant facts and data identify issues decide on the appropriate qualitative and quantitative analytical tools to use and perform the necessary analysis. Time management will be crucial so that you can complete all required steps including providing appropriate recommendations and a plan for their implementation. (See Note 6—“Preparing for and Writing a Case Exam” No. 9B18M058.)When completing any of the above tasks follow the specific instructions provided by your instructor in the course syllabus or course package. These specific instructions always supersede those contained in the Case Guide Series. Different instructors have differing expectations which is good practice for the workplace where you will need to give careful consideration to the preferences of your supervisor or client—in terms of both content and style.case analysis and academic integrityBecause case analysis is complex it may often seem helpful to discuss the case informally or formally with other students before participating in a class discussion writing a report or making a presentation. Managers and consultants often discuss problems with other people within the constraints allowed by confidentiality. Therefore your instructor may allow encourage or even require such discussion. However to ensure academic integrity and to avoid plagiarism unless your instructor has specifically indicated that some degree of discussion is permissible you should consult with your instructor before engaging in any collaboration. This restriction on outside discussion is especially necessary when preparing reports and presentations.It may also seem helpful to search the Internet for teaching notes for cases or for case reports or slide presentations prepared by other students. Academic integrity requires that you refrain from using such resources in full or in part. Any attempt to use the work of others and to pass it off as your own is plagiarism. If the instructor is suspicious that plagiarism might be involved you may be asked to upload a copy of your case report through Turnitin.com.While using the work of others may appear to provide a shortcut to a good grade the quality of online sources and the work of other students is often suspect at best. Most importantly you deprive yourself of the learning opportunities the case method offers.NOTE 2: PERFORMING A CASE ANALYSISIntroduction to Performing a Case analysisFor all case assignments you will be required to analyze the case by performing one or more of the basic steps of analysis (i.e. identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternative solutions and recommend a course of action). Analyze in the broad sense refers to the full process of applying the case method. Analyze can also specifically refer to the case analysis step of probing into and dissecting issues. In both contexts analysis is a critical component of the case method. This note of the Case Guide Series guides you through the specific process of analyzing a case. This method for basic case analysis can be used for several purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation and writing a case exam.identify the issuesThe first step in analyzing the case is to identify the organization’s issues problems and opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) that you will attempt to resolve. A clear understanding of the issues is paramount; otherwise your analysis and your generation of alternative solutions will lack the necessary focus. Although some cases will direct your attention toward specific issues (especially early in your business studies) a considerable degree of judgment is usually required to identify the issues.Pay Attention to QuestionsQuestions from three sources provide important clues about the key issues:The principal actors or characters in the case. These clues are musings or direct questions raised by the principal actors themselves. You can usually find these clues at the beginning and end of the case but they might also be sprinkled throughout the case. Your instructor. Questions can often be found in the syllabus or course package or on the course website. These questions are sometimes intended to limit your analysis to issues that fit within a specific topic of discussion. At other times these questions are intended to focus your attention on the most important issues.The author of the case. In cases presented in textbooks the case author sometimes provides attention-directing questions at the end of the case.If in your analysis of the case you have not answered all of the questions posed in the case or in your course syllabus you have likely either omitted an important issue or become sidetracked by minor issues. Moreover even if you have resolved some issues if you have not addressed all of the questions posed in the case or in your course syllabus your analysis will likely fail to totally satisfy your instructor—and later your supervisor or client. Especially in upper-level courses where the cases are in general more complex your instructor could expect you to look beyond the more obvious issues or those suggested by the case principals to consider issues that people close to the situation could have overlooked. You should address these supplementary issues in addition to not instead of addressing the specific requests posed by principals in the case or by your instructor.Distinguish Symptoms from IssuesTo correctly identify issues it is important to distinguish between symptoms and underlying causes. Your goal should be to focus on the underlying causes. To uncover them ask the question “Why?” until you can no longer provide a satisfactory answer.For instance an organization might be suffering from low productivity. Asking why productivity is low might lead you to conclude that employee morale is low and that employees are not motivated to perform well. Probing further you might find that both of these issues arise because the reward system does not adequately recognize good performance. Low productivity and employee morale are symptoms of the underlying cause.Alternatively an organization might be plagued by low customer retention. Asking why customers are going elsewhere might lead you to conclude that customer service is poor product defect rates are high existing competitors have improved their product and a new competitor has entered the market. The last two items are root causes because asking “why” will not lead to further answers. Therefore they are issues to resolve even though they are not within the organization’s control. Asking “why” for the first two items might lead you to the third issue namely that the company’s goals and reward systems emphasize efficiency rather than product quality. Limit Issues to a Manageable SetOnce you have identified the issues you might need to reduce them to a manageable size to enable you to effectively carry out the subsequent steps in case analysis. For some cases you might be required to resolve a single issue. However you should still identify sub-issues and decide which are most important and which you have the time and space to tackle. For example the issue might be to set an admission price for a new museum. Possible sub-issues to consider include fit with the mission of the museum customers’ ability and willingness to pay the possibility of differential pricing (e.g. lower rates for students) competing forms of entertainment and their admission prices costs that need to be covered by the admission price and the break-even point. To identify the most important sub-issues consider the information in the case the questions discussed in Section 2.1 and the nature of the course. Other cases might present multiple issues. You might find it helpful to look for relationships among the issues and cluster them under one overarching issue. For instance in an organizational behaviour case you might be able to trace several issues—such as unclear decision making processes inability to deal with job stresses and inability to delegate—to the root issue of inadequate training of managers. Dealing with one issue is easier than dealing with three separate issues and will lead to better solutions.Other cases might not have an overarching issue; instead you might face a seemingly unconnected set of distinct issues. You will then need to prioritize the issues using the questions referred to in Section 2.1 and your judgment so that you give adequate time and attention to the most important issues.Analyze the IssuesAnalysis involves examining the issues in detail. It requires that you dissect the issues and consider them closely to understand their nature and key elements.Use Case FactsOne aspect of analysis is using case facts to develop a detailed understanding of the issues. You can use the case facts to help build logical arguments develop findings and draw educated inferences rather than casual guesses. For instance if the issue in an organizational behaviour case is inadequate managerial training facts from the case should indicate that the training provided to managers did not sufficiently clarify decision making processes or how to delegate tasks or both. Or for a marketing case an issue with increased competition might be supported by the case facts describing the entrance of new competitors into the market new products introduced by competitors or price reductions offered by competitors.Many important case facts are contained in a case’s figures and exhibits. These case facts could include data about the worldwide market size the competition the company’s revenues and profit industry sales product prices or organizational charts. Study each figure or exhibit to determine the key insights it offers. Go beyond the specific facts highlighted in the body of the case; figures and exhibits usually include additional facts that can be interpreted in other ways to enhance your analysis. Use Business Concepts Models and ToolsAnother aspect of analysis is the use of business concepts models and tools to analyze the issues. For example in an organizational behaviour case you could use equity theory or expectancy theory to explain why an organization’s reward system has been unsuccessful in motivating employees. In a marketing case you could apply the model of a product life cycle or the concept of a target market; you could also calculate market share and changes in market share. To analyze issues in an accounting case you could use tools such as contribution margin analysis or capital budgeting. In an integrated strategic management case you might apply the concepts of value chain and competitive advantage compute financial ratios and apply tools such as a competitive position matrix and Porter’s five forces framework.You will sometimes be given directions to apply specific concepts or tools; other times you are expected to use your discretion in selecting the most relevant concepts or tools to apply. For some cases the analysis will largely rely on qualitative models and tools. However many cases will involve both qualitative and quantitative elements.Note 7 of the Case Guide Series—“Using Common Tools for Case Analysis” No. 9B18M059—describes some common qualitative and quantitative tools for analyzing issues and possible courses of action.Use Outside Research SparinglyAnalysis might also include conducting and integrating outside research—for example researching the industry and competitors—to supplement the information provided in the case. However for many cases you will encounter in your studies you will not be asked to obtain outside research beyond any background knowledge required to understand the facts of the case. This approach is consistent with the requirement that you put yourself in the role of either the manager or a member of the management team making the decision. You are asked to make that decision based on the same information the actual managers in the actual organization had at that actual point in time. Develop and Evaluate the AlternativesIn this step of a case analysis you first identify alternative solutions to address the issues you previously identified and analyzed and then evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative. The best alternatives will resolve more than one of the identified issues.Develop Alternative SolutionsWhen identifying alternative solutions go beyond the status quo (which might or might not be a viable solution depending on the company’s situation) and beyond identifying a poor alternative and a very good one. Strive to develop multiple viable alternatives that are not chosen with a bias toward or against a particular course of action. Creative thinking will enable you to develop novel approaches. Avoid a premature evaluation of the alternatives and try to develop as many alternatives as possible.Even if you know the course of action the organization ultimately chose resist the temptation for that knowledge to bias your development and evaluation of alternatives. This topic is further discussed in Section 5.3.Evaluate the Alternative SolutionsAssessing the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative solution represents another form of analysis as is quantifying the financial impact of an alternative solution. Some of the case analysis tools described in Note 7 can be used to analyze alternative solutions in addition to being used to analyze issues.When you evaluate your alternatives present a balanced assessment of both the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons). Use of biased or one-sided arguments undermines both the usefulness of your analysis and its credibility. Where possible suggest how to overcome any significant disadvantages. If you have difficulty generating pros and cons establish a set of criteria for decision making and use those criteria to identify pros and cons. For example in a strategic management case decision criteria might include the degree to which the actionfits with the organization’s mission value proposition and goals;fits with stakeholder preferences;is profitable;increases market share;enhances the organization’s brand;capitalizes on specific external opportunities;helps to mitigate external threats;uses internal strengths;avoids or mitigates internal weaknesses; builds on an existing competitive advantage or helps to create a competitive advantage;requires additional resources and competencies;can be accomplished within the organization’s existing structure; ormitigates or increases risks including environmental and reputational risks. The principal in the case or the questions in your syllabus or course pack might have alerted you to some of the decision criteria to be applied. If so be sure to use those as your starting point in establishing a set of decision criteria. Measuring alternatives against decision criteria also helps to keep the analysis consistent reducing bias. For instance by applying the criteria you avoid citing a loss of market share as a disadvantage of one alternative but overlooking the same disadvantage in another alternative that is your implicit favourite.When identifying pros and cons be as specific as possible. For instance instead of stating that an alternative will be unprofitable indicate that the alternative will result in net losses of $72800 and $52500 in years one and two respectively. Instead of claiming that an alternative will increase market share indicate that it will increase market share by an estimated three to four per cent by year five. Rather than arguing that an alternative will capitalize on an organization’s strengths indicate the specific strengths that will be capitalized on and how they will be leveraged. When working with financial measures if you can incorporate all of the information about revenues and costs into a profitability measure it is unnecessary to then itemize individual revenues or expenses as pros and cons. Doing so would be redundant and is not nearly as valuable as doing the financial analysis required to determine profitability.Your evaluation of alternatives should also go beyond obvious disadvantages such as being “costly” or “time-consuming.” A costly alternative might still be highly advisable especially if it generates sufficient advantages. Almost all courses of action involve some cost and time so clearly distinguish how these factors vary from one alternative to the next and when possible provide evidence. For instance one potential product line might require a significant push by the sales department to make it successful whereas another might not require as much effort because it fits better with the organization’s existing product lines and target market.Once you begin to evaluate your alternatives you will probably be able to quickly discard a few alternatives after some preliminary analysis. For instance in a strategic management case one alternative could lie far outside the organization’s existing competencies and contradict one or more of the organization’s clearly stated goals. Discarding one or more unsuitable alternatives will allow you to focus your detailed analysis on the more feasible and more helpful alternatives. Nonetheless some preliminary analysis is important to ensure that you do not rule out options too quickly as a result of your own biases.It can sometimes seem expedient to group a few alternative solutions and evaluate them as a package. However evaluating combined alternatives can be difficult because each component usually has its own pros and cons. Also evaluating packaged alternative solutions often obscures some of the issues resulting in an evaluation that is less thorough than if each alternative had been evaluated separately. Therefore it is usually preferable to wait until the recommendation phase to combine alternatives.Use Case Facts and Business Concepts Models and Theories to Evaluate the AlternativesWhen evaluating alternative solutions you will have another opportunity to introduce key facts from the case and to apply concepts models and theories from the course to support your analysis. Some of those concepts and models will tie directly to the decision criteria referred to in Section 4.2.For instance in a strategic management case alternatives can be evaluated by assessing their fit with stakeholders’ preferences and by identifying resource gaps that would need to be filled to implement each option. In an organizational behaviour case if negative group norms are an issue you could use theory to propose ways to build positive norms such as rewarding desired behaviour and providing feedback about unacceptable behaviours. In a human resource case you could evaluate alternative ways to recruit new managers by considering the theoretical pros and cons of various recruitment techniques and assessing their prospects for success given the company’s specific needs and circumstances. In a finance case solutions could be evaluated against the company’s required rate of return or payback period. In a marketing case you could demonstrate how a proposed product is designed to meet the needs of the firm’s current target market or how its short development time would allow the firm to begin selling the product before its competitors do. The examples in the preceding paragraph illustrate that the evaluation of alternative solutions usually involves some additional analysis. The analysis of the issues and of the alternative solutions should fit together; the concepts models and theories used to analyze the issues should be consistent with those used to evaluate alternative solutions. The goal in both exercises is to provide analyses that demonstrate sound argument and logic and are supported by careful use of the case facts and appropriate analytical techniques (some of which are described in Note 7).RecommendationsApply Criteria for Making Sound RecommendationsThe last step of case analysis is to choose your recommended solution to the issues. Your recommended solution will often consist of a combination of alternatives because issues are usually not so simple that a single solution will suffice. Your goal is to develop recommendations that are useful given the issues that you are trying to resolve; consistent with your analysis; reasonable given the organization and its environment; feasible given the organization’s resources; and convincing to your reader. Articulate the decision criteria (e.g. those listed in Section 4.2) that you have established and applied in developing your recommendations. If the principal in the case has established the decision criteria your recommendations should explicitly address how your recommended solution meets those criteria.Craft Your RecommendationsYour recommendations should include sufficient operational-level details to enable their implementation. For example specify who should implement the recommendations how when and in what priority. You might want to develop a more complete implementation plan and attach it to your report as an appendix after briefly referring to the plan in the body of the report. This approach helps to build a convincing persuasive argument for your recommendations.If you are specifically asked to design a separate implementation plan your recommendations will be more general and the details regarding who how when and in what priority will be included in the implementation plan.Your recommendations should address all the issues you identified and should be both supported by and consistent with your analysis. Where appropriate demonstrate how and why your recommendations would be acceptable to key individuals in the organization. Ensure that the organization is financially able to implement the action plan and has the expertise time and other organizational resources necessary to do so.Base Your Recommendation on the Information You HaveAvoid recommending that further information be obtained or that additional analysis be completed. Instead base your recommendation on the information you have even if you believe more information is needed. Managers rarely have all of the information they desire. If further analysis is absolutely essential your recommendation should specifically state what should be done why and by whom.If the assigned case study is based on actual events you might already know the course of action that management chose or you might be able to obtain this information through further research. Resist the temptation to recommend this alternative which assumes that management made the best decision. Base your recommendation on the information that management had at the time it faced the decision and on the analysis that you conduct. Only time allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization’s actual chosen course of action. Even years later we might not know whether outcomes would have been better for the organization had another alternative been chosen.Evaluate Your RecommendationsBefore finalizing your recommendations take time to evaluate your recommended solution by asking the following key questions:Does the recommended solution address the issues identified in the analysis?Is there theoretical support for the solution?Does the recommendation address the pros and cons identified when you evaluated the alternative solution? Does the recommendation suggest how to mitigate or overcome the most critical disadvantages including any risks posed to the organization? Does the recommended solution meet organizational goals? Is the recommended solution financially viable? Is it feasible from a resource perspective?Is the recommended solution acceptable to various stakeholders of the organization (e.g. management employees shareholders and customers)?Does the recommendation provide sufficient details to enable the organization to implement it? Being able to answer these questions affirmatively will help your recommendations meet the key criteria of being useful consistent reasonable feasible and convincing.Variations on performing a Full Case AnalysisThe basic four steps (identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternative solutions and recommend a course of action) are required for a full case analysis. This section discusses two variations to a full case analysis: analytical cases and partial case analysis.Analytical CasesSome cases might not describe the issues to be resolved but might instead describe issues either in the context of a success story or in a situation where it is too late to resolve the issues. In such cases the focus is on analyzing what can be learned from the organization’s successes or failures so that future prospects for success can be enhanced or similar predicaments can be avoided or better handled by either the organization in the case or others. Business concepts models and tools should still be applied. For example the leadership of an organization could be analyzed to identify which styles of leadership were evident and their effectiveness in the circumstances described in the case. Alternatively a corporate initiative might be analyzed to determine its effectiveness in addressing resistance to change and its application of other change management principles. Partial Case AnalysisDue to time or space constraints your instructor might require only a partial case analysis. For example you might be asked to focus only on identifying and analyzing the issues. Alternatively the case might clearly define the issues and you might be asked to only identify and evaluate possible alternative courses of action. Another form of partial case analysis is a “directed case” in which you are directed to answer a specific set of questions about the case.Even though a full case analysis might not be required it is still important to see how the task you are asked to perform fits within the larger picture of a full-fledged case analysis involving the four steps discussed above.NOTE 3: PREPARING TO DISCUSS A CASEIntroduction to Preparing to Discuss A Case in ClassThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note helps you to adequately prepare to discuss a case in class and to provide meaningful input to the class discussion. The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific. Prepare before ClassTo benefit from many of the opportunities of the case method you need to do your own analysis before class and make your own decisions based on that analysis. Read the case once for familiarity and a second time to gain a full command of the facts so you have good insight into the issues. As you read the case the second time highlight the key points and make notes based on your assigned tasks. If questions about the case are provided in the course syllabus they are intended to be used only as guidelines to identify the issues and some of the analysis to be done. You are still required to come to your own conclusions regarding the issues and relevant analysis. In most instances you are expected to do a full analysis of each case: identify the key issues problems or opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”); analyze the issues using case facts and relevant business tools concepts and models; develop and evaluate some alternative solutions (again drawing on case facts and appropriate tools concepts and models); and recommend a course of action. Prepare two or three pages of notes to take to class. These notes will give you talking points for the class discussion. Use your notes in class to keep track of the points your colleagues raise and to quickly identify opportunities to add to the discussion. As you track the discussion you can formulate arguments to challenge your colleagues’ analysis of the case or to revise your own thoughts about the case. Due to time or space constraints your instructor might require only a partial case analysis. For example you could be asked to focus only on identifying and analyzing the issues. Alternatively the case might clearly define the issues and you could be asked to only identify and evaluate possible solutions. Another form of partial case analysis is a “directed case” in which you are directed to answer a specific set of questions about the case. In such cases your preparation for class should focus on the partial analysis you have been directed to perform.Contribute to In-Class DiscussionYour willingness to participate in the discussion of a case will enable you to consider a variety of viewpoints and insights and thereby gain the full benefits of the class’s collective knowledge and experience.In class the instructor’s role is to facilitate discussion often by asking questions. Students should do most of the talking and you should be prepared to provide supporting reasons for your views. You are expected to show respect for others’ opinions but you are also encouraged to challenge each other. Similarly you are expected to be willing to submit your analysis and conclusions to scrutiny by others without becoming defensive. Several good plans of action are usually possible so do not refrain from taking and maintaining a minority position provided you can defend your position using sound analysis. On the other hand feel free to change your position and recommendations as others’ views emerge and a more complete range of information is assembled. Due to time constraints it is impossible to discuss every aspect of a case in class. Therefore your instructor might steer the discussion in a particular direction or the discussion might centre on only one or two steps of the case analysis; for example identification and analysis of issues might be the focus of one case while on another occasion the issues might be clearly defined and your task could be to focus on developing possible solutions. Nevertheless you are welcome to introduce additional ideas other issues or a new alternative for instance. Doing so will help to avoid feeling frustrated because some of your best ideas are not discussed. While your instructor might not be able to discuss your ideas to your complete satisfaction you can enrich the discussion by noting additional aspects of the case that are worthy of more consideration.Generally the class as a whole will perform a more thorough and creative analysis than would be possible by any one person working alone or by any given small team of students. Therefore do not be discouraged because you did not consider a particular solution. As new ideas are raised be prepared to supplement or adjust your prepared analysis and recommendations. Listen to others in ClassListening to others in class is hard work. Use active listening techniques apply listening etiquette and refrain from activities that will prevent you or others from hearing what the speaker is saying.Use Active Listening TechniquesListen for the ideas the speaker is presenting not just the words being spoken. Link what one speaker is saying to what others have already said. By doing so you can build on their arguments or dispute their conclusions by making direct reference to their statements.Listen critically for the main argument the speaker is presenting so you can understand how the speaker’s argument differs from yours and how the speaker uses case facts concepts and models in analysis. Recognizing the logic of the speaker’s argument aids you in structuring your own argument in response.Active listening helps you build on analyses and arguments presented by previous speakers. Ask questions that clarify a speaker’s use of case facts concepts and models and that clarify the conclusions drawn by the speaker. Briefly summarizing a previous speaker’s comments in your notes ensures that you have understood what a colleague has said. This summary can also help you to establish and refine agreement among class members at various stages of the case discussion process.Avoid making judgments about a speaker’s ideas; quick judgments limit your willingness to hear what the speaker is saying which can lead you to discount the value of your colleague’s contribution to the case discussion. Having preconceived ideas about what a speaker might say can cause you to tune out of the conversation; and when you tune back in you could have missed a critical component of the speaker’s argument.Finally approach a discussion with an open mind: you might discover during the class discussion that you misinterpreted a fact or misapplied a concept or model and that the analysis alternatives and recommendation provided by others is more appropriate than yours.Use Listening EtiquetteListening etiquette begins with focused attention on the speaker. Allowing colleagues to share what they have diligently prepared shows respect for the time they have spent preparing and recognizes the value of their thoughts and contributions. Give feedback to the speaker through your body language: maintain eye contact with the speaker nod and smile when appropriate and physically lean into the conversation. Show respect by allowing the speaker to completely finish speaking. A pause could simply be the speaker taking an opportunity to gather thoughts not an indication that the speaker has finished talking. Appropriate listening etiquette requires that you do not carry on side conversations while a speaker has the floor. Side conversations distract not only the speaker but also those around you and could prevent a speaker’s ideas from being understood by the entire group. Appropriate listening etiquette also requires that you not be distracted by electronic devices. Ensure that your laptop is open to your notes and the case. Turn off your cellphone and put it out of sight. When your attention is distracted by electronic devices you also distract those around you and interfere with the collective understanding of the case.Good listening etiquette helps you to develop essential management competencies skills and abilities. Your technical analytical problem-solving and creative skills will be sharpened as you evaluate your own analysis against that of your colleagues.Enhance the Quality of Your Class ParticipationThere is no one single way to earn high marks for preparation and participation. However the following guidelines can enhance the quality of your class participation:Identify the most important issues including those that might have been overlooked by those closest to the situation.Provide supporting arguments for any statements you make or conclusions you draw but be clear and to the point.Share appropriate analyses; for example bring your proposed organizational chart or your financial analysis on a flash drive or at least be prepared to share a few key specifics of your analysis. This is a clear way to demonstrate your preparation.Come to a decision and be prepared to give your recommendations. Any analysis you have completed is of minimal value if it does not culminate in a decision. Participate in all phases of the discussion—identification and analysis of the issues development and evaluation of alternatives and development of an action plan.Interact with other students. Ask them to provide support for their arguments. State why you disagree with their opinion. Build on their analysis but avoid merely repeating what they have said.note 4: preparing a written case reportintroduction to Preparing a written Case ReportThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note guides you in preparing a written case report by applying the four steps of case analysis described in Note 2.The report described in this note assumes that you are performing a full case analysis (rather than doing a partial case analysis or taking an analytical approach). The guidelines relating to format organization and written communication are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which might differ and be more specific.Play Your Assigned RoleFor each case assignment you will be asked to adopt a specific role as a student consultant employee or manager who is writing a report to a specific person or persons. Depending on your assigned role your analysis could be written as a report to your instructor your supervisor the board of directors or to the client who engaged you as a consultant. In this note we generally refer to the person who will receive the report as the reader. It is important that before you begin writing your report you have a clear understanding of who will be reading your report and that person’s (or those persons’) needs and expectations. Your report should be written with your reader(s) in mind. Your audience is reading the report to gain an understanding of how you propose to solve an issue. They are pressed for time and are often inundated with information. They want their information quickly and easily without having to bring extra thought to the process of reading. The following are some suggestions to make your report reader-friendly:Avoid jargon inside terminology and undefined abbreviations.Keep your sentences simple and straightforward use paragraphs to group similar thoughts and keep your paragraphs short.Make the information easy to find by using headers and page numbers clear and informative section headings and accurate cross-references.Avoid decorative elements and be generous with white space—extra lines—between sections so your reader can easily see how information is clustered.Always use professional tone and tact. However if you are playing the role of an external consultant you can be a little bolder in making your points than if you are playing the role of someone from within the organization—especially when writing to a supervisor.Identify the IssueSBe ClearA high-quality case report focuses on the most important issues and clearly identifies those issues at the start of the report. Without a clear statement of the issues problems and opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) that you intend to address your report will wander aimlessly from one topic to the next and be of limited value to your reader.Settle on a Manageable Set of IssuesIt is important to arrive at a set of relevant issues that are manageable within the size constraints of your written report. (See Note 2 for more information about evaluating and prioritizing issues.) In a short report (e.g. 1000 to 1500 words) you can usually effectively address only two or three issues. In a longer report (e.g. 2500 to 3000 words) you might be able to address five or six issues. Focusing in-depth on a few key issues is generally more productive than a cursory analysis of many issues. Particularly in long or complex cases you will need to make choices among the issues and determine priorities.Use Your Issue Statement to Let the Reader Know What to ExpectAn easy way to let the reader know what to expect in the upcoming analysis is to ensure that the issues you identify are the same issues that you subsequently analyze. Something you first identify as an issue might sometimes dissipate or diminish in priority after you begin your analysis and other issues might surface. This change in priorities is part of the normal iterative process of case analysis. Although you should begin your draft report with a clear issue statement the issue statement will evolve to a certain degree as you complete your report. Double-back after you have completed your initial analysis of the issues and revise your issue statement accordingly. In the final version of the report the issues you identify at the start of the report should be in absolute agreement with your subsequent analysis and recommendations.For a complex case your issue statement should also identify the sub-issues associated with each issue. Noting the sub-issues will help to prepare the reader for the analysis section. For instance the owner of a business might contemplate whether to expand to the United States. As an issue statement the question of whether to expand to the United States is superficial and can be made more precise. A full issue statement might include whether the company has the resources to successfully execute such a move whether the American market is more attractive than the Canadian one and whether such a move fits with the preferences of others who own a significant share of the company. The reader of the report is then set up to expect for example a resource gap analysis; an analysis of market size growth trends and the degree of competition in both the American and Canadian markets; and an analysis of stakeholder preferences. To provide another example a 1999 strategic management case about WestJet Airlines Ltd. asked two questions: “Should WestJet move into Eastern Canada? If so how soon and to what extent?” For that particular case a sample issue statement might beThe main issue facing WestJet is whether to move into Eastern Canada. Three key factors to consider in this decision are the degree to which such a move will require the company to deviate from its successful Southwest model how the move would fit with corporate goals and the level of competition WestJet would face in Eastern Canada compared with in Western Canada. The second issue facing WestJet is to determine the timing and magnitude of any eastward expansion that would be compatible with the company’s goals and resource constraints and align with competitors’ plans and capabilities.This issue statement provides a logical foundation for the following analyses: an assessment of what the Southwest model involves and how it gives WestJet a competitive advantage; an assessment of goals such as keeping debt low and continuing to grow in Western Canada; and an analysis of the competition posed by Air Canada and other low-fare entrants in both Eastern and Western Canada.Although the issue statement does not explicitly lay out the types of analyses that will follow in the report it should provide enough hints and clues that a reader will not be surprised to find a section on “The Southwest Model” or “Analysis of the Competition.” This approach to building an issue statement also ensures that you are being deliberate in selecting and applying various analytical tools and models.Remember a reasonable degree of clarity about the issues is necessary to begin preparing your case report but expect your understanding of the issues to evolve as you progress through your analysis. Ensure that your final issue statement reflects your refined identification of the issues and accurately orients the reader to the rest of the case report.Analyze the IssuesTest the Case FactsTo produce a high-quality report you need to present the case facts in a way that contributes to your analysis and adds value to your report. Avoid merely reiterating or rehashing case material. When you restate case facts be sure they form part of a logical argument and are accompanied by inferences and findings. To ensure that you are using the case facts appropriately read each sentence in your report that includes a fact from the case and ask yourself “What’s my point?” If the answer to this question is not addressed in the same sentence or in the next few lines of the report either delete the fact or explain the inference that you intended to draw. For example there is little value in repeating that “the company currently holds a five per cent market share in Canada” unless you use that fact to support say the contention that the company has room to grow its Canadian customer base prior to expanding into the United States. You do not need to use a formal footnote when referring to material from the case. Direct quotations from the case should be acknowledged by citing the page number of the case in the body of the report but keep direct quotations to a bare minimum using them only where special emphasis is desired.Use Business ConceptsBusiness concepts that are used as part of your analysis should add value to your report and be relevant to your reader. Avoid discussing theories or models unless you explain them sufficiently and fit them to the situation in the case. For example discussing what constitutes a competitive advantage is of little value unless you then proceed to use the VRIO model developed by Jay Barney to illustrate that the organization’s resources and capabilities are valuable rare inimitable and that the firm is organized to exploit those resources and capabilities.The required level of explanation depends on the reader’s knowledge educational background and organizational position. You might not need to explain common business terms but do not assume that your reader is familiar with academic or business models such as Victor Vroom’s expectancy theory or the growth–share matrix developed by Boston Consulting Group. Some business terms such as competitive advantage and core competencies are widely used but different people might understand them differently. When in doubt briefly explain a term. For example you might specify that an organization’s competitive advantage refers to how it intends to attract customers by offering something that is of value to them and differs from what its competitors offer.Specifically and deliberately apply business concepts to the case. For example a discussion of Raymond Vernon’s model of a product life cycle should categorize the company’s products into various life cycle stages and assess the implications of having two-thirds of the company’s products in the maturity and decline stages.A case report is not an academic research report; avoid writing that is overly theoretical and academic. Considerable skill is required to successfully integrate business theory so that it is perceived as practical and not overly conceptual. At the same time you want to show your instructor that you are able to apply the course material and demonstrate to the intended reader that you have the appropriate expertise relevant to the situation.Use External Research SparinglyTo keep your task of writing a case report more manageable most of your reports will not require external research. When your instructor does request external research the results of your research should also be presented to add value to the report making it clear why the research is relevant to the situation. Never append external research to your written report without using that research to help dissect issues or build arguments. Acknowledge the source of any external research with a reference note (e.g. a footnote endnote or in-text citation).Adhere to Length ConstraintsYour instructor will usually set a word or page limit for your report. Learning to be concise and efficient with your writing will prepare you for writing excellent reports for busy professionals.The analysis portion of your report should be substantial. Together with the evaluation of alternatives it will form the bulk of your report. However because of length constraints be judicious in deciding how much and which parts of your analysis to include in your written report.Some of the analysis is mainly for your own benefit—helping you understand the organization and its industry—rather than being of value to the reader. Your instructor might ask you to include such analysis in an appendix with appropriate references to the appendix in the report. Alternatively your instructor might ask you to exclude such analysis from the report to make room for analysis that will be of more value to the reader.Develop and Evaluate Your AlternativesDepending on how long your report is and how complex the issues are you could evaluate as few as three or four alternatives or as many as seven or eight. It is rarely possible to do a good job of evaluating more than eight alternatives.Sometimes it can seem expedient to group a few alternatives together and evaluate them as a package. However it can be difficult to evaluate combined alternatives because each component usually has its own pros and cons. As well evaluating packaged alternatives often obscures some of the issues and results in an evaluation that is less thorough than if each alternative had been evaluated separately. Therefore it is usually preferable to wait until the recommendation phase to combine alternatives. Rather than providing a complete evaluation of the pros and cons of all your alternatives it might be sufficient to only briefly mention some of the alternatives and give a short rationale for why they were discarded early in the evaluation process.Since analysis of alternatives is a key part of any written report ensure that you sufficiently discuss your selected alternatives in the body of the report. Listing the pros and cons in bullet form or presenting such information in tables is an efficient way to evaluate alternatives. However avoid using phrases that have ambiguous meanings such as “requires additional resources” or “uses core competencies.” Such phrases leave the reader to draw inferences. Instead specify the resources that are required or the core competencies to be used.Using lists and tables can also have disadvantages. Too many lists and tables can lead to a report that appears cluttered and is difficult to read. However a report that is text-heavy can also be cumbersome to read. Therefore strike a balance. For instance discuss key pros and cons in paragraph form and supplement the text with a table containing additional pros and cons. Avoid duplicating content in both paragraphs and tables. To help evaluate your alternatives establish a set of decision criteria and use those criteria to identify pros and cons. Measuring alternatives against decision criteria also helps to keep the analysis consistent reducing bias. (Evaluating alternatives is discussed in detail in Note 2.)Make RecommendationsIn general avoid introducing new analysis or new alternatives in the recommendations section of your report.Your recommended solution will be one of the alternatives or a combination of the alternatives you evaluated. In some instances in an effort to keep a report short you might be asked by your instructor to combine your evaluation of alternatives with your recommendations and present only the solutions you recommend for adoption.Your goal is to develop recommendations that will be useful given the issues that you are trying to resolve; consistent with your analysis; reasonable given the organization and its environment; feasible given the organization’s resources; and convincing to your supervisor or client. Your rationale should capture the main reasons for adopting your recommendations and show how you have mitigated any significant drawbacks.Your recommendations should be specific enough that they provide the organization with an action plan including who will implement the recommendations how when and in what priority. In addition to discussing the basic plan of action in the body of the report it is helpful with lengthy cases to provide an implementation chart in an appendix to capture the details at a glance. Some instructors prefer that you separate your recommendations and implementation plan into two sections of your report and provide a more expansive action plan with priorities for implementation detailed timelines and personnel assignments.Content and Format of your ReportLengthYour instructor will specify the number of pages or words for each case assignment. Adhere to the restricted length by organizing your report effectively prioritizing your material avoiding repetition and choosing your words carefully. As discussed in Section 3.2 select a manageable set of issues and ensure your set of alternatives is also workable.Presenting some of your analysis and findings in figures or appendices is an economical use of space often allowing you to present more information in less space than you could in the body of your report (see Section 7.11).FontUse the font specified by your instructor in the assignment or course syllabus or on the course website.SpacingUnless your instructor directs you otherwise reports should be double-spaced. In business reports are normally single-spaced; however double-spacing is usually used in academia to allow room for your instructor to provide feedback.Page NumbersThe executive summary which appears directly after the cover page is not numbered nor is it calculated in the page count or word count. The remaining pages should be numbered but the page number should not be shown on the first page. Pages containing appendices should also be numbered using Roman numerals. Appendices are not included in the page count or word count although your instructor might set a separate limit on the number of appendices or the number of pages used for appendices.Headings and SubheadingsUse headings even in short reports; include subheadings in longer reports. Headings and subheadings improve readability by informing your reader what to expect and by keeping your reader oriented within the structure of your report. They make it easier for a reader to return to the report and quickly find needed information. Headings and subheadings also help you to organize your thoughts more carefully keeping you and subsequently your reader focused.Cover PageA professional report should include a cover page that identifies the name of the person or persons for whom the report is prepared the name of the person or persons who prepared the report the date and the subject of the report as shown in the following sample.	REPORT	TO:		Jordan Kerr President Kerr Manufacturing Ltd.	FROM:		Nancy Drake Eagle Consulting Group	DATE:		September 20 2017	SUBJECT:	Customer Retention DifficultiesExecutive SummaryAn executive summary is required unless your instructor specifies otherwise. Write the executive summary after you complete the rest of the report but place it immediately after the cover page and before the report’s main content.The executive summary is designed to outline the report’s most important issues and recommendations. It should stimulate the reader’s interest in the rest of the report (e.g. by including profit projections for your recommendations or for indicating the projected growth in market share) convincing the reader that reading the whole report will be worthwhile and valuable.For the size of report you will produce while a student the executive summary should not exceed one page (250 words). For a very long report (e.g. 40 or 50 pages) a two-page summary might be justified.IntroductionThe first section in the report is a brief introduction which should capture the purpose and scope of the report. The purpose of the report states why you have been asked to write the report. The scope identifies what you will do in the report (e.g. identify issues analyze those issues and develop and evaluate alternatives).The introduction should never include a salutation such as “Dear Sir” or “Dear Madam.”The introduction is not a brief summary of the case. Your supervisor or the person who hired you as a consultant is already familiar with the facts. However a sentence or two in the introduction about the company’s current situation helps to explain the purpose of the report. As discussed in Section 4.1 case facts should be included in the report only to make a specific point. Therefore do not spend time and words reiterating case facts in the introduction.Depending on the style preferred by your instructor and the complexity of the case identifying the issues can form a key part of the introduction to your report. Usually though you will identify the issues in a subsequent section that focuses exclusively on identifying the issues. The latter approach generally is favoured because it more clearly distinguishes the issues for both you and your reader.In general the introduction should not exceed a half page in length (125 words). If you identify the issues in your introduction the introduction could be as long as a page (250 words).Body of the ReportThe body of the report is typically divided into sections for issues analysis of issues alternatives and recommendations. Especially for the analysis and alternatives sections use subheadings for each issue and each alternative to make your report more readable and user-friendly. Subheadings also help you to organize your thoughts (see Section 7.5). Similarly use paragraphs to separate each group of related thoughts from the next. Use of many short paragraphs will also make your report more readable.If your report includes figures or appendices make specific reference to the figure or appendix at the appropriate place in the body of your report. This reference directs the reader to link the content in the body with the supplementary information.ConclusionThe final section in a written report is the conclusion. This section should provide a very brief (no more than a quarter to a half page) summary of the main findings of the report. The conclusion should also convince the reader that it would be beneficial for the organization to adopt the recommendations in the report. The conclusion should follow strictly from your analysis and avoid introducing any new material since you will have already clearly built your argument in the analysis section of the report.Figures and AppendicesThe Purpose of Figures and AppendicesFigures or appendices are used to capture some of your analysis or recommendations in a form more succinct than prose. Quantitative analysis is usually best presented in figures and appendices. Some forms of qualitative analysis also lend themselves to figures or appendices such as a complete Porter’s five forces analysis or a resource gap analysis. Appendices are also used to present external research organizational charts and other supplementary information. There is no value in reproducing exhibits from the case itself in your report. Instead refer directly to exhibits contained in the case using a phrase such as “Exhibit 3 in the materials provided to us” or “case Exhibit 3.”Depending on the size of your report some items should be incorporated within the body of the report while others should be appended to the back. It is conventional to include relatively short charts or tables or small graphs within the report and to attach longer items to the back of the report. Depending on your instructor’s preferences small charts tables and graphs within the body of a report are referred to as figures illustrations or exhibits; exhibits sometimes refer to material appended to the end of a report but more commonly that content is referred to as appendices. Whatever terminology you use be consistent throughout the report. Each appendix is usually considered to be a stand-alone item that the reader can refer to both during and after reading the body of the report. To help draw the reader into the appendix and to make key information readily accessible in the body of the report figures can be used to summarize key items from an appendix. For example a figure can summarize three or four key financial ratios that are provided as part of a comprehensive ratio analysis shown in the appendix. To use figures and appendices effectively limit their number to suit the size of your report. Also be sure to refer to material from these items in the body of the report.Quantitative Figures and AppendicesQuantitative figures and appendices should provide a level of detail that is suited to the audience and allows the information to be presented in a readable font (at least 10 points and depending on the font preferably 11 or 12 points). For example a board of directors will not want to review dozens of pages of detailed spreadsheet analysis. The board will expect the report writer to make judicious choices about the number of scenarios and level of detail to present. On an income statement it is generally sufficient to display four or five expense categories rather than list the 15 or 20 individual expense items and to state items in thousands or millions of dollars to reduce the number of digits displayed. It will also likely be sufficient to display the most likely worst-case and best-case scenarios. However your supervisor or your instructor might want to see more analysis and a greater level of detail than a board member would require. All quantitative appendices should include a clear trail of assumptions calculations and explanations. For example if your pro forma (forecast) income statement projects a growth in sales of five per cent for each of the next two years clearly state this assumption and explain why this assumption was used (e.g. it represents the average growth rate for the past three years or it is the projected increase in demand for the industry). For financial statements the clearest trail is established when you provide an additional column for assumptions. Alternatively beside each relevant line item insert a superscript reference number that corresponds to a numbered note at the bottom of the financial statement.Numbering of Figures and AppendicesSequentially number (or letter) all figures and appendices to correspond with the order in which they are discussed in the report. Label figures and title appendices to show at a glance what they contain; e.g. “Figure 1: Growth of Market Share 1995 to 2015” or “Appendix 1: Porter’s Five Forces Analysis.”Figures and appendices should also be professional in appearance and format. Word processing software offers a wide range of colours and designs for charts graphs tables and illustrations; however unless you are providing the printed copy of the report (and thus have control over the final appearance) avoid the use of colour and keep illustrations simple. Also avoid the use of special effects such as drop shadows and special complex or elaborate shapes. Use shading (i.e. fill) in tables and illustrations only when absolutely necessary. The width of borders should be between 0.5 and 1.0 points in size. When designing tables use only the borders you need to separate rows and columns. Too many lines vertical or horizontal add clutter to content and often make a table more difficult rather than easier to read.Figures and appendices are typically not included as part of the prescribed word count; however your instructor might prescribe a separate limit on the number of figures and appendices.Writing Style Grammar and SpellingBasic Criteria of a Well-Written ReportYour report should be well-organized and well-written. Careful attention to grammar—including sentence structure paragraph structure word usage and punctuation—and spelling is essential. Your instructor might evaluate this aspect of your report separately or might show an explicit deduction from your overall grade in an effort to emphasize the cost of poor organization faulty grammar and misspellings. A poorly written report will have a negative impact on the reader that will adversely colour the reader’s view of the entire report. For your work to be perceived as professional competent and credible your report needs to be well written.While spell-checkers and other electronic tools are of some value they do not detect all types of errors (e.g. using “weather” instead of “whether”). It is also helpful to have someone else review your report for readability clarity spelling and grammar. However a review by another person does not replace the need to take the time and effort to carefully review your own work. Plan your time to allow at least a day or two between finishing your first draft and editing your report; otherwise you might simply see what you saw the last time. It can also be helpful to read your report aloud or to read the paragraphs in reverse order from the end to the beginning. Finally you should print and proofread your report. Your eyes and brain have the ability to notice things in a printed copy that are not seen on a screen. Prepare and proofread figures and appendices with the same care as applied to the body of the report.Use of “I Think” and “I Believe”Avoid the tendency to preface conclusions and recommendations with phrases such as “I think” “I believe” or “We are of the opinion that.” The entire report represents your thoughts beliefs and opinions. It should be clear from the context whether you are citing facts or drawing a conclusion. While qualifying expressions can be used occasionally for special emphasis their overuse leads to a report that appears tentative.Formal versus Informal ReportsWhen deciding on the tone of a report consider the audience the customary style within an organization and the preferences of your supervisor or instructor. A report to a board of directors of a large corporation should use more formal language than a report to a small business owner. For example it is more formal to write “The report recommends that the organization [do X]” than to write “I recommend that the organization [do Y].”If your report is directed to your supervisor or a client who is the owner of a small business use of “I” or “we” is generally acceptable. As well when addressing the recipient of the report it is generally acceptable to use “you.” However if the sentence refers to the recipient’s department or organization as a whole use “the department” or “the company” or a shortened version of the company name.Opinions differ on whether it is acceptable in a report to use the passive voice (e.g. “It is recommended that”). In general the active voice (e.g. “We recommend that”) is more compelling than the passive voice and it demonstrates more confidence in and ownership of the recommendations. The active voice is also easier to read and generally uses fewer words.Professional Language Tone and TactUse Professional LanguageThe report should use professional language that is both concise and clear. Say something well the first time and you will eliminate repetition and make room for new content. Keep your sentences short. Ensure that each word communicates the meaning you intend.Avoid flowery language. Remember that you are writing a business report not an English essay. Also avoid trite expressions colloquialisms and slang. For example use the word “receive” instead of “get;” use “will earn a profit” instead of “will make money;” use “high risk” rather than “big gamble.”Use words such as never always and very sparingly to avoid exaggeration and generalization. Such words are often unnecessarily inflammatory. As such they might cause the reader to become defensive and they might reduce your credibility.Avoid the use of technical language that your reader will not understand unless you have explained such terms. This guideline also applies to use of theories and models. While you are required to use course concepts in an academic case report (in your role as a student) you are also required to apply them in a way that makes them understandable and relevant to the report recipient (in your assigned role as a subordinate or a consultant).For instance in an organizational behaviour case you might choose to apply expectancy theory to explain why employees are not motivated. It is sufficient to state (with appropriate support) that employees do not believe that behaviours being asked of them will lead to customer satisfaction or they do not believe that their supervisors will reward improvements to customer satisfaction or they do not value the organization’s rewards. Simple clear conclusions are preferable to a theoretical outline of what expectancy theory is and what it says about motivation.Also avoid the use of jargon or “business speak.” Jargon obscures your intended meaning and creates the potential for misunderstanding. Jargon also changes with generations; using jargon that might be understood by a young generation of business people might leave an older businessperson frustrated and feeling excluded. Similarly jargon does not usually translate well or consistently across languages and is potentially confusing excluding or even offending to an international reader. Instead of “reaching out” or “touching base” “contact” the person. Rather than pursuing “buy-in” “seek agreement” on a course of action.Use big words only to the extent that you can do so effectively. In general clarity and conciseness are more important than trying to impress your supervisor client or instructor.Use Constructive LanguageSince a case report culminates in recommended alternatives for action the goal is to be persuasive. Throughout the report be positive constructive tactful and considerate of the reader’s feelings so as not to alienate the reader.Although one important facet of the report is to identify issues care should be taken to avoid overly negative language especially when the report is addressed to your superiors. For example rather than stating that “management has failed to recognize that the current strategy is no longer effective” state that “due to significant changes in the external environment the company has reached the stage where a new strategy is required to ensure its ongoing success.”Avoid accusatory statements such as “poor management” or “management has neglected to.” It is more appropriate to state for example that “there were insufficient controls in place” rather than “there was a lack of internal controls” or “management failed to establish internal controls.” Using appropriate language and tone will make the reader more receptive to what you say in the report about various issues. It will also make your analysis and recommendations more credible.Use Must and Need SparinglyAlso related to tone and tact is the use of the word must. In general avoid telling the recipient of the report what the person must do. Overuse of that word reflects a lack of distinction between essential actions and suggested recommendations. As well must has the connotation of ordering or commanding action. Your reader will react more positively just as you would to phrases such as “I recommend” “It would be beneficial to” or “The company should” rather than being told what the reader must do.It is also preferable to use wording such as “Your department should” rather than “Your department needs to.” Reserve need to and needs to for actions that are absolutely essential to emphasize their critical nature. Use “I recommend” for actions that would be prudent or wise.Case Reports Written by TeamsTeam MeetingsIf you are assigned to complete your case as part of a team plan to meet at least twice and perhaps three times to discuss the entire case. Set an agenda for each meeting and hold each other accountable for being prepared. For example the goals of the first meeting might be to identify the issues and begin to analyze them. Prior to that meeting each member of the team should read the case at least once preferably twice and make some preliminary notes.The goals of the second meeting might be to develop and evaluate alternative solutions and to draft recommendations. Prior to that meeting individual team members might be assigned the task of completing more in-depth analysis (e.g. calculating financial ratios comparing the firm’s product offering and value proposition to those of key competitors). Some team members might be assigned the role of capturing what was accomplished at the previous meeting by drafting one or more sections of the report.The agenda for the final meeting might be to review the draft for consistency clarity grammar and so on and to finalize the report.BrainstormingOne of the key benefits of working in teams is the ability to generate more ideas and to benefit from each another’s ideas. For this advantage to be achieved it is helpful to use a technique called “brainstorming” when identifying the issues and especially when generating alternative solutions. Brainstorming attempts to come up with as many ideas as possible by holding off on any evaluation or criticism of the ideas until a later time.The Task of Writing the ReportThe duty of writing the report can be split or rotated among team members but the final product should represent a team effort and not simply be a piecing together of several individually-crafted sections. The latter approach usually leads to inconsistencies such as analyzing issues that were not mentioned in the identification of issues failing to solve issues that were analyzed or not using much of the analysis contained in appendices. Some editing of a written draft should occur at a subsequent meeting or by means of circulating the draft to all members of the team. The final report is the responsibility of the whole team not the individuals who are assigned all or part of the writing task. Your instructor might require all members of the team to sign off on the report to acknowledge this shared responsibility.Case Analysis and Academic IntegrityBecause case analysis is complex it may often seem helpful to discuss the case informally or formally with other students before participating in a class discussion writing a report or making a presentation. Managers and consultants often discuss problems with other people within the constraints allowed by confidentiality. Therefore your instructor may allow encourage or even require such discussion. However to ensure academic integrity and to avoid plagiarism unless your instructor has specifically indicated that some degree of discussion is permissible you should consult with your instructor before engaging in any collaboration. This restriction on outside discussion is especially necessary when preparing reports and presentations.It may also seem helpful to search the Internet for teaching notes for cases or for case reports or slide presentations prepared by other students. Academic integrity requires that you refrain from using such resources in full or in part. Any attempt to use the work of others and to pass it off as your own is plagiarism. If the instructor is suspicious that plagiarism might be involved you may be asked to upload a copy of your case report through Turnitin.com.While using the work of others may appear to provide a shortcut to a good grade the quality of online sources and the work of other students is often suspect at best. Most importantly you deprive yourself of the learning opportunities the case method offers.Note 5: making an oral case presentationIntroduction to Making An Oral Case PresentationThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note guides you in making an oral presentation to your instructor and class colleagues. The note covers the purpose of a presentation and provides guidelines for preparing and presenting a case to a classroom audience. The note also provides general guidelines related to format organization and verbal communication skills. The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific.Purpose of a Case PresentationEspecially in the business world an oral presentation is typically used to highlight the main findings in an accompanying written report. However the oral presentation is distinct from the written report largely because information presented orally is perceived and absorbed differently from information provided in writing.An oral presentation should provide a broad overview of the main issues and recommendations. It should not provide the same level of detail as a written report so be discerning in choosing which elements of your case analysis to emphasize. The overall goal of a presentation is to convince your audience that you understand the key issues and have a logical and feasible action plan for resolving them.Criteria of a Good PresentationA good presentation conveys information in a format that enables your audience to comprehend the intended message. With any communication information is encoded by the sender transmitted using one or more media and decoded by the receiver. At any point in the process communication can be disrupted hindering the clarity of the message. A communication disruption can occur for a variety of reasons including the amount of information being conveyed the presentation tools and techniques being used and the skills of the presenters. Good presenters are aware of the potential disruptions to a message and craft their delivery to minimize those disruptions.For each case you will be asked to play a specific role as a student consultant employee or manager who is writing a report or making a presentation to a specific person or group or both. Depending on the directions of your instructor you will be presenting to your instructor a manager a board of directors or a client who engages you as a consultant. A good presentation addresses the needs and knowledge of the intended audience. However while the presentation (and accompanying report) might be intended for one individual you should present to the entire audience in the room. For instance if the presentation (and accompanying report) is being directed to the vice-president of marketing address your presentation to the vice-president and thank the individual for “inviting the rest of the management team to the presentation.” Always use professional tone and tact. However if you are playing the role of an external consultant you can be a little bolder in making your points than if you are playing the role of someone from within the organization—especially when presenting to a supervisor. Content of a Case PresentationPresentation of a Full Case ReportOnce a case analysis is complete and the report has been written review the report and identify the key portions that the individuals reading the report need to know. These highlights will form the outline of your presentation and will help you to present what is written in the report and avoid introducing different material. Your audience will read your report to gain greater understanding of the information included in your presentation. A full case presentation typically consists of three parts: the issues key alternatives and your recommendation.First describe the issue or issues you identified as being key to the case. Briefly provide your reasons for selecting those issues reflecting the theories and models you used during the analysis stage (see Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054). Be mindful of your audience and offer your theoretical analysis only if it adds value. Use of too much theory especially when it is not well applied undermines your expertise and credibility. It is inappropriate and impractical to repeat all the theoretical analysis contained in the report or to cover it in detail during a presentation. Second present the key alternatives you identified as being possible solutions to the issue or issues providing a brief rationale for each. Restraint is key: do not include in your presentation everything contained in your report. A presentation is a high-level review of your report mainly focused on what you identified as the issues and ways to resolve them.Finally offer your recommendation. Persuade the audience that the solutions you have chosen will best resolve the issue. Anticipate objections the audience might raise and counter them in your presentation before they are raised.As you structure your presentation use the slide sorter capability of the presentation software to bring a logical flow to the content. Once you have the high-level points outlined on slides you can easily write the script for the presentation since you will be writing with the end of your presentation (i.e. your proposed solution) in mind.Presentation without a Case ReportIn some courses your instructor will ask you either to complete only specific components of a full case study or to present the case without writing a full report. If you are presenting only individual components of a case analysis performing a full analysis as outlined in Note 2 (identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternative and recommend a course of action) will better equip you to present the analysis of the specific components your instructor requires. For example if you are presenting only the issues your preparation should include analysis of those issues so you can confidently present the issue statement. If only the presentation is required it is essential that you have a sufficient understanding of the underlying issues and analysis to select the most appropriate material for your presentation. Because you will not have a written report to use as a roadmap for the presentation it is crucial that you follow the four case analysis steps in Note 2 so that your understanding is sufficient to present the case in a convincing manner and so you can support your recommendations with sound logic. Provide enough detail in your presentation to assure your instructor that you understand the issues and have applied appropriate theory; at the same time avoid overwhelming your audience with too much content and theory.AudioVisual AidsYour presentation should be accompanied by audiovisual aids such as presentation slides (e.g. PowerPoint Prezi or Google Slides) video clips a blackboard or whiteboard a flipchart or handouts. These audiovisual aids can give your audience an outline of your presentation and show them some details (e.g. a ratio analysis or market share analysis) or an illustration (e.g. an effective advertisement). However use audiovisual aids thoughtfully; avoid diverting your audience’s attention from both you as the presenter and the main message you are communicating. The focus should be on the content not on the technology being used to present the content.Presentation slides should be simple and use at least 28-point font. Choose a sans serif font for text. It is simpler cleaner and easier to read on a screen. It also does not pixelate when enlarged by the projector making it clearer to read even for the audience at the back of the room. Use short phrases that supplement—and do not reiterate—what you are going to say. Do not fill the slides with text or your audience will be more focused on reading the slides than on listening to you. It might be necessary especially with slides containing financial statements to break the statements into sections on two or three slides. When communicating a message that contains financial data consider whether a pie chart or graph might better convey the message.Animations should be used with caution; they can be distracting and cause your audience to focus more on the graphics than on the content of your presentation. Use subtle transitions and animations with bullet points “appearing” or “wiping in.” Avoid animated graphics or cartoon clip art; they quickly become annoying to the audience and reduce the professionalism of your presentation. If you use a graphic or photograph use high-quality images that will not pixelate or degrade as they are resized on the screen.Know the room in which you are presenting especially how the lighting affects the room’s projection screen. The room’s lighting will dictate the colours you choose for the background and font in the presentation. For example if the room has windows choose starkly contrasted background and font colours so the text does not get washed out by the light making it difficult for the audience to read.If you prepare your slides using your own computer and software preview your presentation in the school’s lab to ensure that your presentation is compatible with the version of software available in the classroom and that your computer is compatible with the projection system. If you have the opportunity preview the presentation in the room in which you will be delivering the presentation so you can assess whether the content of the slides is readable. If you intend to use a blackboard or whiteboard plan how you will use it. Include in your speaking notes a quick sketch of what you intend to write on the board and the location of each component you will write. This preparation enhances your professionalism and keeps the presentation moving.Presentation SkillsThe role identified for you in the case or by your instructor will guide how you approach your presentation. Nonetheless some key skills are required for all presentations.During your presentation speak loudly enough to be heard by all members of your audience. Use an expressive voice speak at an appropriate speed (which might feel unnaturally slow) pause where appropriate for emphasis or to allow your audience to absorb information and make regular eye contact with members of the audience. Remember that you are the authority on the subject so do not just read what you have written in your report. Choose words and structure your sentences to serve the nature and capacity of the audience. Keep in mind that people’s ability to absorb information is lower when the information is presented orally rather than in writing.While it can be more comfortable to stand behind the podium where you can read from your notes step out from the podium—at least periodically—to connect with your audience. Be comfortable. Become a professional and polished version of yourself. If you are holding cue cards or speaking notes keep them still as you refer to them so they do not draw attention away from the message you are communicating.Presentation skills improve with practice. Script adjust and practise your presentation until it fits the time you are allotted. By exceeding the time limit you reflect a lack of preparation. Your instructor might cut you off or if more than one presentation is scheduled in the class period you might infringe on the time allotted to the next presenter.Handling Audience QuestionsA presentation usually includes time at the end for questions and answers but some presenters prefer to take questions throughout the presentation. Whichever you choose let your audience know at the start of the presentation how you will be taking questions. Some presenters take a mixed approach responding to brief questions of clarification during the presentation but reserving more detailed comments and questions until the presentation is finished. This approach works well in classroom presentations when the whole class is responsible for interacting with the presenter.The ability to listen can set you apart as a business professional and active listening skills enable you to understand what members of the audience are asking. Be present and listen fully to the question; if you start formulating an answer before the audience member has finished asking the question you risk responding inappropriately or incompletely.Acknowledge the audience member and the question. Move toward the person who asked the question—this is a perfect opportunity to move away from the podium. Establish eye contact with the person during the question and the first part of your answer then broaden your attention to other audience members. Thank the individual for the question and if other members of the audience might not have heard the question repeat it so all can hear. If the question refers to an option you considered but did not discuss during the presentation respond appropriately and explain why you did not include the topic in the presentation or why you discarded the alternative. If the question raises a point you had not considered thank the questioner for the input and acknowledge that you did not include it in your evaluation. If time allows discuss the topic further.Always be gracious courteous and professional.Team PresentationsIn the case of a team presentation all members of the team should be involved in some aspect of the presentation and the transition from one presenter to the next should be as seamless as possible. Each member’s part in the presentation should be agreed on in advance to avoid both duplication and omission of material. As you prepare the presentation identify each member’s strengths and weaknesses so that you can capitalize on individual presentation skills and specialized understanding of the content. During the presentation team members who are not speaking should avoid being a distraction. Stand back from the speaker and remain still. Do not whisper among yourselves stand in an awkward place or fidget. Where possible play an appropriate supportive role; for example distribute handouts or run the slide show to free the speaker of these duties. To ensure your presentation is professional script and rehearse the presentation several times including transitions from one presenter to the next.Role Of The AudienceAs a member of the audience you are actively involved in the presentation. Your preparation of the case for class discussion should equip you to critically evaluate the presenter’s approach to the case. (See Note 2 and Note 3 of the Case Guide Series—“Preparing to Discuss a Case” No. 9B18M055.) Your instructor might also evaluate your preparation and participation in the class.Just as the presenter plays an assigned role so too should the audience members. For example if you are taking the role of the board ask questions that board members would ask. Such questions might ask about the level of risk assigned to a course of action the estimated return on investment and the impact on other stakeholders of the organization should the recommended solution be implemented.Listen actively focus on the speaker allow the speaker to completely finish listen for the ideas being presented and listen critically for the presenter’s main arguments. Good questions are a challenge to formulate and they should respond to the content you heard from the presenter. Bring a two- or three-page summary of the case to class and make notes in the margins of that summary to compare what the speaker presents against your own preparation of the case. Ask questions that clarify the presenter’s position so that you can persuasively argue your own position.Again at all times be gracious courteous and respectful of the presenter and of other audience members.Dress for SuccessAttire for presentations should be appropriate for a business setting and should also reflect your audience. Appropriate attire includes dress pants skirt dress shirt blouse and/or tie. Jackets are optional except for when you make a formal presentation to a board of directors. Your clothing should not distract audience members from focusing on the content of your presentation; it should also reflect the highest regard for professionalism.Note 6: preparing for and writing a case examIntroduction to Writing a Case ExamThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note guides you in preparing for and successfully writing a case exam. The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific. Purpose of a Case ExamThe task of performing a case analysis might form part or all of your examination for a course. If it forms only part of your exam your instructor will likely use short cases or direct you to restrict your analysis to specific tasks. If performing a case analysis represents the entire exam you should expect a longer case with less direction although your instructor might still provide a set of questions to guide your analysis. A case exam is designed to test your ability to apply the case method under constraints of time and resources. If an exam is performed in a closed-book setting you are expected to remember and understand course concepts models and theories well enough to apply them to the assigned case. If an exam is performed in an open-book setting you must still have sufficient knowledge of concepts models and theories to be able to recognize which are relevant to the case and where to find them quickly in your notes or text.Your instructor’s decision to evaluate your performance using a case exam indicates that the main learning outcome is application of the course concepts models and theories. Application requires a higher level of understanding than memorization and recall. This approach is also consistent with the classroom discussions if your course has made significant use of cases. Preparing for a Case ExamStudying for a case exam is unlike studying for other types of examinations in that the goal of a case exam is application rather than memorization or recall. It also differs in that you do not know what type of questions to expect on the exam. For both of these reasons you are limited in terms of what you can study before the exam. If the exam is open-book your preparation should include determining the material you are most likely to want to use and how you will access it quickly.Reread Notes and TextsReread your notes and reread your text in anticipation of the course concepts models and theories you are most likely to be asked to apply in the case exam. Your priorities should be guided by the following:Course learning outcomes in your course syllabus or on the course website.The types of cases assigned throughout the course—the size of case nature of issues topics covered and types of industries.While a case exam will not ask you to recall specific facts from cases used in class cases used in class do provide some important clues regarding the issues you will encounter on the case exam.Types and depth of analysis required during the course—full case analysis partial case analysis or simply answering questions.Due to time limits in a case exam you will not be expected to apply the same depth of analysis that you would be expected to apply in class discussion written reports or presentations. Nonetheless a case exam will often require that you perform all of the usual steps of analysis. If all steps are not required your instructor will usually alert you to this requirement before the exam. (For a discussion of partial and full case analysis and directed cases see Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054.)Concepts theories and models emphasized in class discussions especially those that were discussed frequently.Any instructions your instructor provides about the focus of the case exam.Practise Writing a Case under Exam ConditionsIt is useful to review one or two of the cases discussed in the course and redo the analysis under the time constraint imposed by the exam. Because you will be familiar with the case consider giving yourself less time than will be available for the exam. Also simulate exam conditions including whether it is closed-book or open-book.Practising for an exam helps you assess which case analysis steps will require better time management during the exam. Practice also gives you some confidence that you can perform the expected analysis within the allowable time.Writing a Case ExamWriting a case exam can be an anxious time given the time constraints and the uncertainty of being thrust into a new situation. Successfully writing a case exam requires that you remain calm and manage your time wisely.Read the InstructionsCarefully read the instructions to maximize your opportunity to excel in the exam.Your instructor will likely provide some questions either at the end of the case or in a separate document. In a directed case your assignment might simply be to answer those questions. In a case requiring partial or full case analysis the questions should help you to identify key issues and the analyses you need to perform. For example questions such as “What threats are posed by traditional and non-traditional competitors?” and “Is the company’s competitive advantage sustainable? If not how can it build a sustainable competitive advantage?” help you to identify potential issues as being increasing competitive threats and lack of a sustainable competitive advantage. The questions also suggest two types of analyses that might be helpful—a competitive position matrix and a competitive advantage analysis. Questions such as “What are the pros and cons for the company focusing on a niche market?” or “Assess the potential of increasing the number of product lines” help direct your attention to two potential alternative solutions for evaluation: serving a niche market or increasing the number of product lines.In addition to carefully reviewing any questions provided by your instructor look for instructions regarding:the role you are to assume when performing the analysis and writing the report;steps in the case method that are required for the exam;key issues; andthe format of the report.For example consider these instructions:Acting in the capacity of a consultant write a report to James Alou chief executive officer who has asked you to evaluate the proposed new sales incentive plan for Andover Manufacturing Inc. (AMI).Your report should identify the issues associated with the new incentive plan analyze the issues and present appropriate recommendations. Each recommendation should be justified by clearly identifying which issue or issues the recommendation is designed to address by presenting its major advantages and by addressing any significant disadvantages. It is NOT necessary to present possible alternatives that you do not recommend.An appropriate heading introduction (which can include identifying the issues) and brief conclusion are required. An executive summary is NOT required.These instructions specify the role you are to play (a consultant). They direct your attention to evaluation of the new incentive plan and suggest that there are issues related to that plan. The instructions also restrict the steps you are to perform in completing your analysis. Lastly the instructions provide guidelines for the report format.Watch for additional instructions regarding numbering of pages required page headers and assembly of your exam.Read the CaseGive yourself time to read through the case twice. In your first read skim the case. Your goal during the first read is to develop a preliminary understanding of the issues problems or opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) facing the decision maker. In the first read resist the temptation to highlight text in the case except for key questions raised by the principal actors or characters. Questions raised by the principals are important to note because they help you to identify key issues. (For further information about how to read a case see Note 1 of the Case Guide Series—“Understanding the Case Method” No. 9B18M053.)Your second read of the case should be more deliberate to help you gain a better understanding of the issues and any potential solutions proposed by the principals. You should also identify relevant analyses to perform and case facts that you can use when performing those analyses. Highlighting the case at this stage will help you use the case facts effectively. In a three-hour case exam you should spend no more than 45 minutes reading the case.Prepare an OutlineWhile preparing an outline of your report can appear to be an extra step that consumes valuable time taking 15 minutes to briefly map out key parts of your report helps you to allocate your time and will likely save you time later. An outline provides a valuable roadmap to keep you focused allowing you to move methodically from one step to the next. It prevents you from losing sight of excellent ideas and becomes especially important as you begin to feel more rushed toward the end of the exam.Your outline should identify the main parts of your report the key issues important points for your analysis of the issues and the tools you intend to use and at least some alternative solutions—particularly those raised by the principals in the case or identified in questions that accompany the case.Your outline could also include key decision criteria to use when evaluating the alternative solutions you develop (see Section 4.4.5 or Note 2 Section 4.2).Write Your ReportWhen writing your report start each section on a separate page and double-space your answer. This format will allow you to easily add more material later without crowding what you have done so far. Remember to use proper report format unless otherwise directed. Here again it is important that you have carefully read the instructions so that you do not spend time on tasks that do not help you earn marks.Refer to Note 4 of the Case Guide Series—“Preparing a Written Case Report” No. 9B18M056—for more information about the required components of a report and how to write an effective case report. Bear in mind that an instructor generally scales back the expectations for a report written under the time pressure of an exam. Prioritize and Manage Your TimeAllocate your time to the most important tasks: the analysis of issues and the evaluation of alternative solutions. For the introductory paragraph and the conclusion do just enough to achieve their required purpose. Provide an executive summary only if your instructor directs you to provide one. During an exam as long as you identify the key issues and key alternatives it is generally better to analyze fewer issues and alternatives well than to attempt to deal with too many issues and alternatives which might result in you running out of time. Here your report outline will come in especially handy; refer to it to stay on track.Identify the IssuesKeep your identification of issues brief and to the point so that you avoid repeating content when you perform the subsequent analysis. Also ensure that your set of issues is manageable.Analyze the IssuesUse concepts models and tools to analyze the issues so that your analysis reflects the necessary rigour to demonstrate your mastery of course concepts. However here again adhere to your outline so that you do justice to all of your chosen models and tools.Identify Alternative SolutionsIdentify any potential solutions that were considered by the principals in the case or that were suggested by your instructor in the directions and questions provided to you. Since keeping things the same is seldom a viable alternative you are generally better to allocate your time to alternatives that offer some improvement. Identify other alternatives as long as your set of alternative solutions is still manageable. Evaluate Alternative SolutionsEvaluate how effectively potential solutions will resolve one or more of the issues you have identified. Establish your set of decision criteria to help you quickly generate the pros and cons of your proposed solutions and to evaluate your alternatives consistently. For example in a strategic management case decision criteria might include the degree to which the action:fits with the organization’s mission value proposition and goals;fits with stakeholder preferences;is profitable;capitalizes on specific external opportunities;builds on an existing competitive advantage or helps to create a competitive advantage; orrequires additional resources and competencies.It is especially important when performing a case analysis in an exam setting to choose a manageable set of criteria so that you can fully capitalize on a framework for developing pros and cons. (See Note 2 for detailed information about evaluating alternatives.)Make Your RecommendationIn an exam setting the most important parts of your recommendation are what you recommend and a brief summary of why—specifically how your recommendation resolves the issues you identified. As time allows you can fill in the who how and when. If your instructor requires an implementation plan consider using a chart which is the most efficient way to complete this task during an exam especially as your time draws to a close.Note 7: USING common tools for case analysisIntroduction to Common Tools for Case AnalysisThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note provides you with a few of the more popular tools used in case analysis and guides you in using those tools.The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific.horizontal AnalysisThe data presented by the case author(s) in figures and exhibits will provide you with some of the best opportunities for value-added analysis. Reorganize and summarize the data. Perform additional calculations. Draw new comparisons. In doing so you will be able to interpret existing information in new ways and provide support for new findings.When data are presented in numerical form a logical first step in analyzing the data is to compute percentage changes from one year to the next or to assess the magnitude of the differences between one company and the next. Look for trends such as whether the company is gaining or losing market share compared with its competitors and whether sales are growing or shrinking and the rate of change.When calculating year-over-year percentage changes the earlier year’s number forms the base:For example suppose you are given the following numbers:The percentage decrease in sales from 2015 to 2016 The percentage decrease in sales from 2016 to 2017  For the two-year period:The percentage decrease in sales from 2015 to 2017 From the above horizontal analysis you can conclude that sales are declining at an increasing rate.VERTICAL ANALYSISVertical analysis or common size analysis expresses each item on a financial statement in terms of a percentage of a base amount. The base for income statement items is usually sales. For example you can calculate cost of goods sold (COGS) or other expenses as a percentage of sales. Potential bases for statement of financial position (balance sheet) items are total assets or total liabilities. For example you can calculate inventory as a percentage of total assets or you can calculate current liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities.Vertical analysis facilitates comparison between one business and its competitors of different sizes. It also allows a business to compare its own results from one year to the next. For instance if sales were higher one would expect COGS to also be higher. By expressing COGS as a percentage of sales we can determine whether sales price increases are keeping pace with cost increases.For example suppose you are given the sales numbers in Section 2.1 and the following numbers:You might note that for 2015 and 2016 COGS as a percentage of sales was fairly steady but in 2017 the percentage rose significantly to 47.9 per cent. Referring back to Section 2.1 you might also note that sales had declined from the previous two years leading to questions about not only the drop in sales but also the reasons for the sharp increase in COGS.RATIO ANALYSISIn many cases it is beneficial to analyze an organization’s financial performance by performing ratio analysis. Ratios show the relationship among selected items of financial statement data as expressed by a percentage rate or proportion. Ratios are useful only if they are compared to ratios of prior years ratios of competitors industry standards and forecast ratios. Be judicious in both your calculation and interpretation of ratios to ensure that your financial statement analysis adds value to your report. The most valid external comparisons involve companies within the same industry or industry benchmarks produced by such organizations as J.D. Power or Deloitte. General benchmarks known as “rules of thumb” are sometimes available; however industry benchmarks take precedence over general benchmarks since ratios can be expected to vary considerably from one industry to the next. When a ratio mixes balance sheet (statement of financial position) values and income statement (statement of earnings) values use an average of the balance sheet values. (This approach is used because an income statement provides information about a company’s performance over a period of time whereas a balance sheet is comprised of values at one point in time.) When the value at the beginning of the time period is unavailable (e.g. when only two years’ data are available and you are calculating comparison ratios for two years) use year-end values as a proxy for the average. However the more asset values fluctuate over that period of time the more use of a year-end value distorts the picture.The following formula is used to calculate the average of balance sheet values:where one year’s beginning value is the prior year’s ending value.Provided below are the formulas and brief interpretations of three types of ratios—profitability or activity ratios liquidity ratios and solvency ratios.Profitability or Activity RatiosProfitability ratios measure a business’s ability to generate earnings from providing goods and services. Profitability ratios can be useful for comparing a business’s present and past performance or comparing a business with that of its competitors or industry benchmarks during the same period in time. The three main profitability ratios are return on assets (ROA) return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS). As will be shown below in Sections 4.12 through 4.18 changes to ROA can be explained by calculating other ratios.Return on Assets Return on assets (ROA) indicates the profitability of a business relative to the assets invested in the business. An ROA of 10 per cent indicates that for every dollar invested in assets the business earns 10 cents in profit. Instead of net income (also referred to as profit or earnings) income from continuing operations can be used to provide a better benchmark for future comparison since discontinued operations will no longer be available to generate profit.						ROA depends on two factors: profit margin and asset turnover. Thus the equation for ROA can also be stated as follows:Profit Margin Profit margin indicates the profitability of a business relative to its sales revenue and reflects how well a business is controlling its various expenses. Expressing net income relative to sales revenue provides a more meaningful comparison of the business’s performance from one year to another than merely comparing net income in the two years. A profit margin of 12 per cent indicates that for every dollar of sales revenue the business has 12 cents left in profit after all expenses are deducted. Profit margin in turn can be dissected to analyze how well individual expenses are being controlled.Gross Profit Margin  Gross profit is a preliminary measure of profitability. It measures a company’s ability to maintain an adequate selling price above its cost of goods sold (COGS). Gross profit also measures the company’s ability to pay operating and other expenses. If the gross profit margin is 30 per cent the business has 30 cents left from every dollar of sales revenue to pay operating and other expenses. In other words for every dollar in sales revenue it costs the business on average 70 cents to make or buy the products it is selling leaving 30 cents to pay operating expenses such as wages and rent and other expenses such as interest. A declining gross profit margin is a sign that selling prices are not keeping up with increases in COGS.Expense Ratios Expense ratios measure the portion of income that is spent on specific expenses. An expense ratio that is higher this year than the previous year could indicate that the company has potential problems with controlling costs in individual expense categories such as selling expenses administrative expenses and interest expenses. However increasing the amount spent on expenses could also be the key to future growth as would be the case for example if the business significantly increased its advertising and promotion expenditures or added new salespeople in an effort to increase sales.Note that although you can calculate an expense ratio using COGS the result would be the complement of the gross profit margin (i.e. if the gross profit margin is 34 per cent then COGS is 66 per cent of the net sales).Asset TurnoverThe asset turnover ratio the second main determinant of ROA measures how well a business uses its assets to generate sales. If the asset turnover ratio is 8.33 per cent the business is generating 8.33 cents in sales for every dollar invested in assets. Thus the two keys to improving a company’s ROA are to improve the profitability of each sale of a good or service and to sell more goods and services in the first place.Inventory TurnoverThe inventory turnover ratio measures the average number of times inventory is sold during the period. The higher this ratio the more quickly inventory is being sold and therefore the more efficiently inventory is being used to generate sales.The days in inventory ratio measures the average age of the inventory—the average number of days products remain in inventory measured from the time the company produces or purchases the product to the time the product is sold to customers. Days in inventory is an easier ratio to interpret than inventory turnover but calculating days in inventory relies on first computing inventory turnover.Receivables Turnover The receivables turnover ratio measures the number of times on average that receivables are collected during the year.The average collection period shows the average number of days it takes a business to collect accounts receivables from customers. The average collection period should be evaluated in relation to the business’s credit terms; for many businesses accounts are due within 30 days.The average collection period is the easier of the two ratios to interpret but it cannot be calculated without first computing the receivables turnover.Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) is the second main ratio that helps to assess the profitability of a business. It measures the return on shareholders’ equity—the profit relative to the investment of common shareholders (the true owners of the corporation). Because preferred dividends are reserved for and are paid out to preferred shareholders they do not belong to the common shareholders and are subtracted from income before calculating ROE.A ratio of 17 per cent indicates that for every dollar invested by common shareholders the corporation earns 17 cents in profit. ROE is affected by two factors: ROA and debt to total assets. Thus to improve its ROE a firm can improve its ROA increase its use of debt financing (known as increasing the use of leverage) or both. However more reliance on debt financing also increases the risk that the organization will be unable to make interest and principal repayments.Earnings per ShareThe third main measure of profitability is earnings per share (EPS) which looks at profitability from the perspective of common shareholders who are the residual owners of the corporation. It expresses net income on a per share basis. EPS is widely used to compare profitability from one year to the next or to compare actual profitability against expected profitability. The calculation looks simple but several accounting rules are applied to determine both the numerator (the income available to common shareholders) and the denominator (the weighted average number of common shares).EPS is the only ratio that public companies are required to publish in their financial statements. Announcements of expected or actual EPS can cause stock prices to fluctuate as the market reacts to the company’s initial projections and its subsequent performance against those goals. However because companies each have widely varying numbers of common shares EPS cannot be used for intercompany comparisons. Price-Earnings RatioThe price-earnings (P/E) ratio looks at the market price of shares compared with earnings expressed on a per share basis. A P/E ratio of 10 indicates that an investor is willing to pay $10 for every $1 the share currently earns. The P/E ratio is a measure of investors’ beliefs about the company’s future earnings potential. A high ratio indicates investors have confidence in the company and expect significant growth in profitability. Therefore they are willing to pay a higher price for shares. It might also indicate that the shares are overvalued in the marketplace making it a good time to sell those shares. A decreasing ratio indicates declining investor confidence. The average P/E ratio over the past 80 years has ranged between 14 and 15.Liquidity RatiosLiquidity ratios evaluate a company’s ability to pay its short-term debts as they come due. The ratios can be used within a company to track a business’s performance by comparing the ratios over periods of time. The ratios can also be used to assess a company’s performance compared with the performance of another company or compared with industry benchmarks. Current RatioCurrent assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash sold or used up within one year of the organization’s financial statement date. Current liabilities are debts that are expected to be paid within one year of the organization’s financial statement date.The current ratio measures a company’s current assets against its current liabilities. A current ratio of 1.8 means that for every dollar of current liabilities the business has $1.80 in current assets. A general rule of thumb is that this ratio should be at least 1.5 to 2.0 although as noted earlier industry benchmarks always take precedence over general rules of thumb. Acid Test Ratio (Quick Ratio)The acid test ratio assesses a company’s ability to pay its current liabilities with short-term assets that can be quickly converted to cash. An acid test ratio of 0.9 means that for every dollar a company has in current liabilities it has 90 cents in highly liquid assets to pay those current debts. As a rule of thumb a minimum healthy ratio is 0.9 to 1.0.The current ratio and the acid test ratio both measure a business’s short-term ability to pay its current debts as they come due. However the acid test ratio is a more accurate measure of liquidity because it excludes current assets that are not quickly turned into cash (e.g. inventory) or intended to be turned into cash (e.g. prepaid insurance and supplies). The inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover ratios discussed earlier as activity ratios (see Sections 4.1.6 and 4.1.7) are also liquidity ratios because a business’s ability to pay off its own current liabilities depends to a great extent on how quickly it can sell its inventory and in turn how quickly it can collect payment from its customers. For example if days in inventory is 53 days and the collection period is 45 days the business needs to wait a total of 98 days (days in inventory + collection period) before cash is available to pay its own suppliers and to pay other operating expenses.Solvency RatiosDebt RatioThe debt to total assets ratio (also referred to as the debt ratio) measures the percentage of a business’s assets that are financed by creditors. The ratio indicates how heavily a business relies on debt financing. A ratio of 0.55 means that for every dollar of assets 55 cents is financed by debt; or expressed another way 55 per cent of a business’s assets are financed by debt.The level of debt that a business can handle depends on its earnings. As well more capital intensive industries generally use more debt financing. However in general as the percentage of debt to total assets increases the risk also increases that the business may be unable to meet its maturing obligations and ongoing interest payments. In general 0.60 to 0.70 is an acceptable level.Debt to Equity RatioThe debt to equity (D/E) ratio is a variation of the debt ratio. Where the debt to total assets ratio measures how much of a company’s assets are financed by debt the D/E ratio measures how much of a company’s debt is covered by shareholders’ equity (including retained earnings). A ratio of 0.7 means that for every dollar of shareholders’ equity there is 70 cents in liabilities. A high D/E ratio usually means that a company is being aggressive in using debt financing to leverage growth.Both the debt to assets and debt to equity ratios are sometimes calculated using long-term liabilities instead of total liabilities.Times Interest EarnedWhere EBIT refers to earnings before interest and taxes.The times interest earned ratio (also known as the interest coverage ratio) is one measure of a corporation’s ability to generate sufficient earnings to make interest payments as they come due. An acceptable range is typically 2.0 to 3.0 although again the suitability of this range varies by industry.Assessing ProfitabilityIf you are asked to evaluate the profitability of a specific alternative course of action your approach should depend on the level of detail provided in the case facts. A simple measure of profitability is to calculate the contribution margin (CM) of individual products.Variable costs are those costs that vary directly on a total basis with increases or decreases in sales such as labour or materials. As production volume increases total variable costs increase proportionately; as production volume decreases total variable costs decrease proportionately. Fixed costs are those costs that do not vary on a total basis with changes in sales; rather they need to be paid regardless of the level of business activity. Total fixed costs remain the same as long as sales fall within a relevant range of production. Examples of fixed costs include rent insurance utilities and property taxes.Variable costs per unit do not change as production volume changes while fixed costs per unit do change as production volume changes.You can calculate the contribution margin to compare the profitability of different services or products. Obviously the larger the margin the better for the company; but in any event a positive contribution margin is required to help cover the fixed costs associated with production and distribution. Another simple measure of profitability is to calculate the gross profit margin (see Section 4.1.3). Contribution margin is the better measure of profitability for decision making purposes—especially because it can be used to perform break-even analysis—but it requires having sufficient information from the case to distinguish between variable and fixed costs. Calculating the gross profit does not require the same detail.Finally if sufficient information is available in the case pro forma (forecast) income statements should be prepared for each alternative course of action you are evaluating.Break-even AnalysisOne of the most helpful management accounting tools for case analysis is break-even analysis. While the goal of a business is not to just break even (i.e. earn zero profit) knowing the break-even point for a specific product or a group of products helps to measure how risky a given new product venture might be. If expected sales do not exceed the break-even point a business will need to reconsider the product’s price find ways to reduce costs or both.A helpful variation on break-even analysis is to calculate the sales (in units or dollars) required to reach a target level of profit.Market Potential and Market Share Market potential (MP) is an estimate of the revenue a company can expect to make from a product or service it plans to market.Where	N = total number of customers 	P = average selling price 	Q = average annual consumption quantity	MS = market share which is the actual percentage of industry sales captured by a companySWOT AnalysisA SWOT analysis is an evaluation of the strengths (S) weaknesses (W) opportunities (O) and threats (T) faced by an organization. It is a popular tool for analyzing an organization’s internal and external environments to identify various issues. A SWOT analysis can also be used to generate pros and cons when evaluating alternative courses of action.Although strengths and weaknesses are listed first in the acronym the assessment of opportunities and threats (i.e. the external analysis) is usually performed before the internal analysis.Opportunities represent conditions in the external environment that an organization can take advantage of (by formulating and implementing appropriate strategies) to enhance its competitiveness profitability and overall success. Opportunities should not be confused with alternatives. For example an increase in the demand for dark chocolate because of its cancer-fighting antioxidants and heart-healthy properties represents an opportunity (a favourable environmental condition). To take advantage of this opportunity a confectionery company might consider alternatives such as switching some of its milk chocolate production capacity to dark chocolate or acquiring a company that specializes in the manufacture of dark chocolate.Threats represent conditions in the external environment that endanger the competitiveness profitability and success of the organization. For example the increasing incidence of obesity and diabetes pose threats to a confectionery company. Opportunities represent possibilities while threats pose constraints. Both are conditions that are outside an organization’s control. Strengths are activities the organization does very well or characteristics that enhance its competitiveness. Strengths can be found in skills expertise physical assets human assets or competitive advantages. Weaknesses are activities the organization does poorly (compared with its competitors) resources it lacks or internal conditions that make the organization vulnerable. These are areas that an organization can improve on; for example a retail business is vulnerable if it does not have an online sales presence but its competitors do.PESTLE AnalysisA PESTLE analysis (see Figure 1) identifies changes and trends in six segments of the general societal or macro environment: political (P) economic (E) socio-cultural (S) technological (T) legal (L) and environmental (E). The analysis is also variably referred to as PESTEL (or PEST analysis if only the first four factors are considered). It evaluates the potential impact of changes and trends in the environment on both the industry and the organization considering how the changes and trends affect supply demand competition and each element of the company’s value chain.A PESTLE analysis can be used as a stand-alone tool or it can be used in conjunction with a SWOT analysis to enhance the thoroughness of external analysis by more methodically identifying opportunities and threats.Figure 1: PESTLE AnalysisIn the body of a report use PESTLE to identify only the most important external forces. For example for an automobile manufacturer the most relevant forces might be abandonment of free trade agreements (P); increasing interest rates for car loans (E); pressure to use rapid transit systems (S); development of self-driving cars (T); higher damage awards for product safety violations (L); and lower emissions requirements (E). If it adds value to your report a more extensive description of external forces can be put in an appendix. Porter’s Five Forces Framework Porter’s five forces framework (see Figure 2) is used to evaluate five competitive forces that influence an industry’s profit potential or attractiveness and to identify where economic profit lies in an industry’s value chain (see Section 133.1). A five forces analysis can also be used to identify specific opportunities and threats in the industry such as introduction of a substitute product or increased competitive rivalry.Figure 2: Porter's Five ForcesThe threat of new entrants increases when barriers to entry are low for example whenthere are no economies of scale related to production marketing or distribution;product differentiation is low so new firms do not have to spend heavily on branding;capital requirements are low which makes entry into an industry less risky;switching costs are low so new firms do not need to offer major improvements to get a customer to switch brands; orfirms have easy access to distribution channels. Intensity of industry rivalry increases for example whenthe number of competitors increases;competitors are equal in size and capability; demand for the product is growing slowly; orcustomers’ costs to switch brands are low.Threat of substitutes (products that provide similar benefits) is high for example whenthe relative price of substitute products decreases; orcustomer switching costs are low.Supplier power is high for example whena supplier group is dominated by few companies;the supplier group’s product is unique;there are no or few substitute inputs; orsuppliers pose a credible threat of integrating forward into the organization’s business.Buyer power is high for example whenthe buyer group is concentrated or buyers purchase in large volumes;products purchased are undifferentiated;buyers earn low profits which creates pressure to lower purchasing costs; orbuyers pose a credible threat of integrating backward to make the organization’s product.In the body of a report Porter’s five forces analysis should be used judiciously to highlight key forces that make an industry attractive or unattractive to enter. For example in analyzing whether a restaurant should expand into catering an organization would encounter an unattractive industry characterized by high threat of new entrants (capital requirements are relatively low and product differentiation is hard to achieve); fierce rivalry (many restaurants are doing catering and demand for catered meals is growing slowly); high supplier power (there are only a few commercial food service companies); high buyer power (there are many caterers for buyers to choose from and often they offer the same type of food); and a moderately high threat of substitutes (going to a restaurant cooking yourself). A more complete Porter’s five forces can be placed in an appendix if you deem this to be value-added. Stakeholder AnalysisA stakeholder analysis identifies the relevant internal and external stakeholders (e.g. customers shareholders employees distributors suppliers and the local community) and what they need or expect from an organization as it pertains to the dilemma under consideration.After identifying potential stakeholders and their interests a company can either align its actions to meet the interests and needs of the stakeholders or it can manage its relationships with stakeholders by addressing the consequences of the company’s actions on the stakeholders.A grid similar to that shown in Figure 7 for resource gap analysis can be used to summarize the existing preferences of various stakeholders the new required preferences (i.e. to align with a particular alternative) major gaps between stakeholder expectations and corporate actions and ways to reduce those gaps. Industry Key Success FactorsIndustry key success factors (KSFs) identify what a company needs to succeed or win in the industry. KSFs include product qualities organizational capabilities resources and market achievements that combine to create value for customers and are critical for long-term competitive success in the industry. An industry usually has only two or three KSFs; rarely are there more than five or six.Identifying KSFs allows a company to assess its performance against industry KSFs. A company wants to perform well on all KSFs and be distinctively better on one or two to develop a competitive advantage. Value Chain AnalysisIndustry Value ChainAn industry value chain (see Figure 3) consists of the activities that contribute to the process of firms within an industry providing a valuable product or service. Most businesses buy products or supplies from another company transform them and then sell them to customers. Therefore an industry value chain includes the firms’ own value chains as well as the value chains of their suppliers and distributors.Figure 3: Industry Value Chain13.2	Organization Value ChainAn organization can use a value chain analysis to systematically identify its own capabilities and competitive advantages. Part of a sample value chain analysis for an organization is provided in Figure 4. The analysis is designed to evaluate the value chain of Birks Group a Canadian jewellery company. Analyzing Birks’ value chain identifies where the company’s primary and supporting activities can be leveraged and integrated to add value and build an advantage over a competitor.Figure 4: Value Chain Analysis Birks Group Competitive Position MatrixA competitive position matrix identifies competitive dimensions that add value and are important to the customer. Potential dimensions include price delivery price/quality mix product/service characteristics product/service scope and geographical scope. The matrix uses these dimensions to compare the positions of competitors in an industry (see Figure 5). Competitors with similar characteristics and market positions can be grouped to make competitive analysis more manageable.Figure 5: Competitive Position Matrix Canadian Furniture Retail Strategic Cluster Map A strategic cluster map (or strategic group map) provides a convenient visualization of the competitive position of various firms in the industry but the map limits the choice of competitive dimensions to two (see Figure 6).Figure 6: Strategic Cluster Map Canadian Furniture Retail Resource Gap AnalysisA resource gap analysis identifies an organization’s major gaps in resources and skills. It can be used to analyze issues and to develop the pros and cons for alternative courses of action.In Figure 7 a partially completed template for a resource-gap analysis identifies gaps in a university’s ability to serve adult learners through a continuing education program. Figure 7: Resource Gap Analysis Core CompetenciesCore competencies are skills and capabilities that an organization uses exceptionally well such as developing curriculum for a diverse audience or delivering instructional content using user-friendly online platforms. Analysis of an organization’s core competencies can be used to identify strengths as part of a SWOT analysis. When core competencies involve competitively important value chain activities the competencies can evolve into competitive advantages. Competitive Advantage Analysis: VRIOThe VRIO framework developed by Jay Barney suggests that resources and capabilities may offer a competitive advantage if they are valuable (V) rare (R) and inimitable (I) (i.e. difficult to imitate) and the firm is organized (O) to capitalize on those resources and capabilities. Resources are valuable if they contribute to meeting customers’ needs at the price that customers are willing to pay. Resources are also valuable if they enable a company to develop alternatives to exploit opportunities mitigate threats and improve efficiency or effectiveness. Resources and capabilities are rare if only a few competing firms possess them. Resources and capabilities are inimitable if they are costly and difficult to imitate. Resources could be inimitable because they are physically unique; have been built up over time based on specific experiences (e.g. unique historical conditions); result from interpersonal relationships group norms or culture (social complexity); or because it is difficult to identify the resource its value or its competitive advantages (causal ambiguity). Finally resources and capabilities provide a competitive advantage only if the firm is organized—that is the firm has the necessary structure such as the appropriate employees management organization control systems reward systems and culture—to capitalize on its resources and capabilities. Case Analysis and Academic IntegrityBecause case analysis is complex it may often seem helpful to discuss the case informally or formally with other students before participating in a class discussion writing a report or making a presentation. Managers and consultants often discuss problems with other people within the constraints allowed by confidentiality. Therefore your instructor may allow encourage or even require such discussion. However to ensure academic integrity and to avoid plagiarism unless your instructor has specifically indicated that some degree of discussion is permissible you should consult with your instructor before engaging in any collaboration. This restriction on outside discussion is especially necessary when preparing reports and presentations.It may also seem helpful to search the Internet for teaching notes for cases or for case reports or slide presentations prepared by other students. Academic integrity requires that you refrain from using such resources in full or in part. Any attempt to use the work of others and to pass it off as your own is plagiarism. If the instructor is suspicious that plagiarism might be involved you may be asked to upload a copy of your case report through Turnitin.com.While using the work of others may appear to provide a shortcut to a good grade the quality of online sources and the work of other students is often suspect at best. Most importantly you deprive yourself of the learning opportunities the case method offers.,0.0,,,,
